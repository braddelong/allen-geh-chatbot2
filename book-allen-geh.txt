Chapter 1

The great divergence

Economic history is the queen of the social sciences. Her subject is
The Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, the title of Adam
Smith’s great book. Economists seek the ‘causes’ in a timeless
theory of economic development, while economic historians find
them in a dynamic process of historical change. Economic history
has become particularly exciting in recent years since the scope of
the fundamental question – ‘why are some countries rich and
others poor?’ – has gone global. Fifty years ago, the question was
‘why did the Industrial Revolution happen in England rather than
France?’ Research on China, India, and the Middle East has
emphasized the inherent dynamism of the world’s great
civilizations, so today we must ask why economic growth took off
in Europe rather than Asia or Africa.

Data on incomes in the distant past are not robust, but it looks as
though the differences in prosperity between countries in 1500
were small. The present division between rich and poor largely
emerged since Vasco da Gama sailed to India and Columbus
discovered the Americas.

We can divide the last 500 years into three periods. The first,
which lasted from 1500 to about 1800, was the mercantilist era. It
began with the voyages of Columbus and da Gama, which led to

1


an integrated global economy, and ended with the Industrial
Revolution. The Americas were settled and exported silver, sugar,
and tobacco; Africans were shipped as slaves to the Americas to
produce these goods; and Asia sent spices, textiles, and porcelain
to Europe. The leading European countries sought to increase
their trade by acquiring colonies and using tariffs and war to
prevent other countries from trading with them. European
manufacturing was promoted at the expense of the colonies, but
economic development, as such, was not the objective.

This changed in the second period of catch-up in the 19th century.
By the time Napoleon was defeated at Waterloo in 1815, Britain
had established a lead in industry and was out-competing other
countries. Western Europe and the USA made economic
development  a priority and tried to achieve it with a standard

set of four policies: creation of a unified national market by
eliminating internal tariffs and building transportation
infrastructure;  the erection of an external tariff to protect their
industries from British competition; the chartering of banks to
stabilize the currency and finance industrial investment; and the
establishment of mass education to upgrade the labour force.

These policies were successful in Western Europe and North
America, and the countries in these regions joined Britain to form
today’s club of rich nations. Some Latin American countries
adopted these policies incompletely and without great success.

British competition de-industrialized most of Asia, and Africa
exported palm oil, cocoa, and minerals once the British slave trade
was ended in 1807.

In the 20th century, the policies that had worked in Western
Europe, especially in Germany, and the USA proved less effective
in countries that had not yet developed. Most technology is
invented in rich countries, and they develop technologies that use
more and more capital to increase the productivity of their ever
more expensive labour. Much of this new technology is not

cost-effective in low-wage countries, but it is what they need in

2


order to catch up to the West. Most countries have adopted
modern technology to some degree, but not rapidly enough to
overtake the rich countries. The countries that have closed the gap
with the West in the 20th century have done so with a Big Push
that has used planning and investment coordination to jump
ahead.

Before we can learn how some countries became rich, we must
establish when they became rich. Between 1500 and 1800, today’s
rich countries forged a small lead that can be measured in terms
of GDP (gross domestic product) per person (Table 1). In 1820,
Europe was already the richest continent. GDP per head was twice
that of much of the world. The most prosperous country was the
Netherlands, with an average income (GDP) of $1,838 per person.
The   Low Countries had boomed in the 17th century, and the main
question of economic policy elsewhere was how to catch up with
the Dutch. The British were doing that. The Industrial Revolution
had been under way for two generations, and Great Britain was
the second richest economy, with an income of $1,706 in 1820.

Western Europe and Britain’s offshoots (Canada, Australia, New
Zealand, and the USA) had incomes of between $1,100 and

$1,200. The rest of the world lagged behind, with per capita
incomes between $500 and $700. Africa was the poorest
continent at $415.

Between 1820 and the present, the income gaps have expanded
with only a few exceptions. The countries that were richest in
1820 have grown the most. Today’s rich countries have average
incomes of $25,000–$30,000, much of Asia and Latin America
average $5,000–$10,000, while sub-Saharan Africa has reached
only $1,387. The phenomenon of divergence is highlighted in
Figure 1, in which the regions plotted towards the right with
higher incomes in 1820 had the greatest income growth factors,
and the regions on the left with lower initial incomes had smaller
growth factors. Europe and the British offshoots realized income
gains of 17- to 25-fold. Eastern Europe and much of Asia started

GDP measures the total output of goods and services in an economy as well as the total income 
generated by it. In this table, GDP is valued in 1990 US dollars so
the volume of production (real income) can be compared over time and across space.

with lower incomes and realized increases of 10-fold. South Asia,
the Middle East, and much of sub-Saharan Africa were less
fortunate, being both poorer in 1820 and achieving income gains
of  only 3- to 6-fold. They have fallen even further behind the West.
The ‘divergence equation’ summarizes this pattern.

There are exceptions to income divergence. East Asia is the most
important, for it is the one region that bucked the trend and
improved   its position. Japan was the greatest success of the 20th
century, for it was indubitably a poor country in 1820 and yet
managed to close the income gap with the West. Equally dramatic
has been the growth of South Korea and Taiwan. The Soviet
Union was another, although less complete, success. China may be
repeating the trick today.

Industrialization and de-industrialization have been major causes of
the divergence in world incomes (Figure 2). In 1750, most of the
world’s manufacturing took place in China (33% of the world total)
and the Indian subcontinent (25%). Production per person was

lower in Asia than in the richer countries of Western Europe, but the
differentials were comparatively small. By 1913, the world had been
transformed. The Chinese and Indian shares of world
manufacturing had dropped to 4% and 1% respectively. The UK, the
USA, and Europe accounted for three-quarters of the total.

Manufacturing output per head in the UK was 38 times that in
China and 58 times that in India. Not only had British output grown
enormously, but manufacturing had declined absolutely in China
and    India as their textile and metallurgical industries were driven
out of business by mechanized producers in the West. In the 19th
century, Asia was transformed from the world’s manufacturing
centre  into classic underdeveloped countries specialized in the
production and export of agricultural commodities.

Figure 2 highlights some key turning points in the history of the
world. From 1750 to 1880, the British Industrial Revolution was
the major event. In this period, Britain’s share of world
manufacturing increased from 2% to 23%, and it was British
competition   that destroyed traditional manufacturing in Asia. The
period from 1880 to the Second World War was marked by the
industrialization of the USA and continental Europe including
Germany,    in particular. Their shares reached 33% and 24%,
respectively, in 1938. Britain lost ground to these competitors, and
its   share dropped to 13%. Since the Second World War, the USSR’s
share of world manufacturing output rose sharply until the 1980s
and then crashed precipitously as the post-Soviet countries went
into economic decline. The East Asian miracle saw a rise in the
share of world manufacturing in Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea
to 17%. China has also been industrializing since 1980, and
produced 9% of world manufactures in 2006. If China catches up
to   the West, the world will have come full circle.

Real wages

GDP is not an adequate measure of wellbeing. It leaves out many
factors such as health, life expectancy, and educational

8


attainment. In addition, absence of data often makes GDP hard to
compute, and, in any event, it may be misleading because it
averages the incomes of the rich with the poor. These problems
can be finessed by calculating ‘real wages’, that is, the standard of
living that can be bought with one’s earnings. Real wages tell us
much about the standard of living of the average person and help
explain the origins and spread of modern industry, for the
incentive to increase the amount of machinery used by each
worker is greatest where labour is dearest.

I focus on labourers. To measure their standard of living, their
wages must be compared to the prices of consumer goods, and
those prices must be averaged to calculate a consumer price index.
My index is the cost of maintaining a man at ‘bare-bones
subsistence’ (the least-cost way of staying alive). The diet is

quasi-vegetarian. Boiled grain or unleavened bread provide most of
the calories, legumes are a protein-rich complement, and butter or
vegetable oil provides a little fat. This was typical fare around the
world  in 1500. Francisco Pelsaert, a Dutch merchant who visited
India in the early 17th century, observed that the people near Delhi
‘have nothing but a little kitchery [kedgeree] made of green pulse
mixed with rice . . . eaten with butter in the evening, in the day time
they munch a little parched pulse or other grain’. The workmen
‘know little of the taste of meat’. Indeed, most meats were taboo.

Table 2 shows the consumption pattern defining bare-bones
subsistence for an adult male. The diet is based on the cheapest
grain available in each part of the world – oats in northwestern
Europe, maize in Mexico, millet in northern India, rice in coastal
China, and so on. The quantity of the grain is chosen, so that the
diet yields 1,940 calories per day. Non-food spending is restricted
to scraps of cloth, a bit of fuel, and the odd candle. Most spending
is on food, and, indeed, on the carbohydrate at the core of the diet.

The fundamental standard of living question is whether a fully
employed labourer earned enough to support a family at bare-

bones subsistence. Figure 3 shows the ratio of full-time earnings
to the family’s cost of subsistence. Today, living standards are
similar across Europe. The 15th century was the last time that was
true. Living standards then were also high: labourers earned
about four times bare-bones subsistence. By the 18th century,
however, a great divergence had occurred in Europe. The standard
of living on the continent collapsed, and labourers earned only
enough to purchase the items in Table 2 or equivalent. In the
Middle Ages, Florentine workers ate bread, but by the 18th

century they could afford only polenta made from maize, newly
introduced from the Americas.

In contrast, labourers in Amsterdam and London still earned four
times bare-bones subsistence. Workers in London in 1750 did not,
however, eat four times the oatmeal specified in Table 2. Instead,
they upgraded their diet to white bread, beef, and beer. It was only
on the Celtic fringe that the British ate oats. As Doctor Johnson
remarked, oats are ‘a grain which in England is generally given to
horses  but in Scotland supports the people’. The workers of
southern England also had the income to purchase the luxuries of
the  18th century such as the odd book, a mirror, sugar, or tea.

Real wages have diverged as dramatically as GDP per head. Figure
4 shows the real wage of labourers in London from 1300 to the
present and in Beijing from 1738. In 1820, the London real wage
was already four times subsistence, and the ratio has grown to
fifty  – mainly since 1870.

4. Subsistence ratio, London and Beijing

In the poor countries of the world, however, real wages are still at
bare-bones subsistence. In 1990, the World Bank defined a world
poverty line at $1 per day (since raised to $1.25 due to inflation).
This figure, which is based on the poverty lines of present-day
poor countries, corresponds to bare-bones subsistence as defined
in Table 2. Those baskets averaged $1.30 per person per day when
priced in 2010. More than one billion people (15% of the world’s
population) live below that line today, and the proportion was far
higher in 1500. Labourers in Beijing were this poor in the 19th
century. China’s remarkable growth in recent decades has boosted
the labourer’s standard of living to only six times subsistence – a
level that British workers realized 150 years ago.

We can now appreciate the low incomes shown in Table 1 for
1820. They are expressed in 1990 dollars, and, at that time,

bare-bones subsistence cost $1 per day or $365 per year. Average
income in sub-Saharan Africa in 1820 was $415 – only 15% more
than bare-bones subsistence, which was the standard of living of
the vast majority. In most of Asia and Eastern Europe, which had
more capital-intensive farming systems and hierarchical societies,

12


the average incomes were only $500–$700. Most people lived at
subsistence, and the surplus was extracted by the state, the
aristocracy, and the rich merchants. Northwestern Europe and the
USA had incomes four to six times subsistence. Only in these
societies did workers live above bare-bones subsistence, as Figure
3 shows. These economies were sufficiently productive to also
support aristocracies and merchants.

Bare-bones subsistence has further implications for social
wellbeing and economic progress. First, people living on the
bare-bones diet are short. The average height of Italians who

enlisted in the Habsburg army fell from 167 cm to 162 cm as their
diet shifted from bread to polenta. In contrast, English soldiers in
the 18th century averaged 172 cm due to their better nutrition.
(Today, the average man is 176–8 cm tall in the USA, UK, and
Italy, while the Dutch are 184 cm tall.) When people’s heights are
stunted for lack of food, their life expectation is also cut, and their
health in general declines. Second, people living at subsistence are
less well educated. Sir Frederick Eden, who surveyed labourers’
incomes and spending patterns in England in the 1790s, described
a London gardener who spent 6 pence per week sending two of his
children to school. The family bought wheat bread, meat, beer,
sugar,  and tea, and his earnings (£37.75 per year) were about four
times subsistence ( just under £10). If their income were suddenly
cut to subsistence, vast economies would have had to be made,
and who can doubt that the children would have been removed
from school? High wages contributed to economic growth by
sustaining good health and supporting widespread education.

Finally, and most paradoxically, bare-bones subsistence removes
the economic motivation for a country to develop economically.
The need for more output from a day’s work is great, but labour is
so cheap that businesses have no incentive to invent or adopt
machinery to raise productivity. Bare-bones subsistence is a
poverty   trap. The Industrial Revolution was the result of high
wages   – and not just their cause.

Chapter 2

The rise of the West

Why has the world become increasingly unequal? Both ‘funda-
mentals’ like geography, institutions, or culture and ‘accidents of
history’ played a role.

Geography is important. Malaria holds back the tropics, and
Britain’s coal deposits underpinned the Industrial Revolution.
Geography is rarely the whole explanation, however, for its
significance depends on technology and economic
opportunities;   indeed, one of the aims of technology is to reduce
the   burden of bad geography. In the 18th century, for instance,
the location of coal and iron deposits determined the location of
blast furnaces. Today, ocean transportation is so cheap that
Japan and Korea obtain their coal and iron ore from Australia
and Brazil.

Culture has been a popular explanation for economic success. Max
Weber, for instance, contended that Protestantism made northern
Europeans more rational and hard-working than anyone else.

Weber’s theory looked plausible in 1905 when Protestant Britain
was richer than Catholic Italy. Today, however, the reverse is true,
and Weber’s theory is no longer tenable. Another cultural
argument claims that peasant farmers in the Third World are poor
because they cling to traditional methods and fail to respond to
economic incentives. The contrary, however, is true: farmers in

14


poor countries experiment with new crops and methods, employ
labour to the degree that it pays, adopt modern fertilizers and
seeds when they are cost-effective, and shift their cropping in
response to price changes like farmers in the rich countries.

Peasants are poor because they receive low prices for their crops
and because they lack appropriate technology – not because they
refuse to use it.

While cultural explanations that invoke irrationality and laziness
are suspect, there are aspects of culture that affect economic
performance. In particular, widespread literacy and numeracy
have    been necessary (if not sufficient) conditions for economic
success since the 17th century. These mental skills help trade to
flourish and science and technology to develop. Literacy and
numeracy are spread by mass education, which has become a
universal strategy for economic development.

The importance of political and legal institutions is hotly
debated. Many economists argue that economic success is the
result  of secure property rights, low taxes, and minimal
government. Arbitrary government is bad for growth because it
leads    to high taxes, regulations, corruption, and rent-seeking

– all of which reduce the incentive to produce. These views are
applied historically by arguing that absolutist monarchies such
as  Spain and France or empires like those of China, Rome, or the
Aztecs stifled economic activity by prohibiting international
trade, threatening property or, indeed, life itself. These views, of
course, echo those of Adam Smith and other 18th-century
liberals. Successful economic development was due to the
replacement of absolutism with representative government. The
Netherlands revolted against Spanish rule in 1568 and organized
itself    as a republic. The country grew rapidly afterwards. The
English economy suffered in the early 17th century under the
rules   of James I and Charles I, who imposed taxes of disputed
legality and levied forced loans. Charles’s attempts to rule
without Parliament failed, civil war broke out, and, in 1649, the

15


King was convicted of treason and executed. After the
Restoration, disputes between Crown and Parliament continued,
however, finally culminating in the Glorious Revolution of 1688
when James II fled the country and Parliament gave the Crown
to William and Mary. With Parliament supreme, absolutism was
checked, and the economy boomed. So goes the economists’
history.

However, as economists have been celebrating the superiority of
English institutions, historians have been investigating how
absolutist monarchy and Oriental despotism actually worked. The
usual finding is that they promoted peace, order, and good
government. Trade flourished as a result, regional specialization
increased, and cities expanded. As regions became more
specialized,   the national income rose in a process that has come to
be  called ‘Smithian growth’. The greatest threat to prosperity was
invasion by barbarians attracted to the civilization’s wealth – not
expropriation or intervention by the emperor.

The first globalization

While institutions, culture, and geography always lurk in the
background, technological change, globalization, and economic
policy   turn out to have been the immediate causes of unequal
development. The Industrial Revolution itself, moreover, was the
result    of the first phase of globalization that began in the late 15th
century with the voyages of Columbus, Magellan, and the other
great explorers. The great divergence, therefore, begins with the
first globalization.

Globalization required ships that could sail the high seas.
Europeans did not have them until the 15th century. These newly
invented ‘full-rigged’ ships had three masts – the front and middle
were square-rigged and the aft was lateen-rigged. Sturdier hulls
and the use of rudders instead of steering oars made ships that
could navigate the globe.

16


Initially, the commercial impact of the full-rigged ship was felt in
Europe. In the 15th century, the Dutch began shipping Polish
grain from Danzig to the Netherlands and, by the late 16th
century, to Spain, Portugal, and the Mediterranean. Textiles
quickly followed. Italian cities had dominated the cloth industry
in the Middle Ages, but English and Dutch producers contrived to
make lightweight worsted cloth in imitation of Italian fabrics. By
the early 17th century, the Mediterranean was flooded with these
‘new draperies’, and the English and Dutch drove the Italians out
of business. This was a momentous change and began the
relocation of Europe’s manufacturing industry to northwestern
Europe.

The most dramatic impact of the full-rigged ship, however, was in
the Voyages of Discovery. Networks of Indian, Arab, and Venetian
merchants shipped pepper and spices from Asia, across the
Middle   East, to Europe, and the Portuguese hoped to out-compete
them with an all-water route. In the 15th century, the Portuguese
sailed south along the African coast in search of a sea route to the
East.

In 1498, Vasco da Gama reached Cochin in India, and filled his
ship with pepper. The price in Cochin was about 4% of the price in
Europe (Figure 5). The other 96% of the price difference was
transport costs. By 1760, the gap between the Indian and English
prices  in Figure 5 had dropped by 85%, and that reduction is a
measure of the efficiency gain from the all-sea route. In the 16th
century, however, only Portugal benefited from the cut in
transport  costs since its state trading company kept the price at
the medieval level and pocketed the savings as profits. It was the
arrival of the English and Dutch East Indies companies in the
early  17th century that broke Portugal’s maritime monopoly and
cut the European price by two-thirds. The real price received by
Indian sellers increased by only a small amount: most of the
efficiency gains from the Asian trade were reaped by European
consumers.

The Genoese sailor Christopher Columbus, of course, proposed the
alternative of sailing west from Europe directly to Asia. He talked
King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain into financing his
expedition and landed in the Bahamas on 12 October 1492, convinced
that   he had reached the East Indies. But it was the Americas he had
‘discovered’, and that changed the history of the world.

Columbus’s and da Gama’s voyages set off a scramble for empire,
and the Portuguese and Spanish were the early winners. In the
two battles of Diu (1509 and 1538), the Portuguese defeated
Venetian, Ottoman, and Asian forces and established their
hegemony  in the Indian Ocean. Then they pushed east towards
Indonesia, establishing a string of colonies along the way.

Eventually, the Portuguese reached the fabled Spice Islands (that
is, the Moluccas in Indonesia), where nutmeg, cloves, and mace
were indigenous. The Portuguese also accidentally discovered
Brazil in 1500, which became their biggest colony.

18


Spain’s empire was even richer. The greatest successes were the
conquests of the Aztec Empire in 1521 by Hernán Cortés and the
Inca Empire 11 years later by Francisco Pizarro. In both cases,
small Spanish forces defeated large native armies through a
combination of firearms, horses, guile, and smallpox. Looting the
Aztecs  and the Incas brought immediate wealth to Spain.

Conquest was followed by the discovery of large silver deposits in
Bolivia and Mexico. The silver flooding into Spain paid for the
Habsburg armies fighting the Protestants across Europe, provided
Europeans with the cash to buy up Asian goods, and unleashed
decades  of inflation known as the Price Revolution.

The imperial exploits of northern Europeans were modest in the
16th century. The English sent Giovanni Caboto (John Cabot)
west in 1497, and he made it to Cape Breton, or Newfoundland.
This counted as discovery, although Basque sailors had been
fishing the Grand Banks for centuries. The French sent Jacques
Cartier to Canada on three voyages in the 1530s and 1540s. Fur
trading with the natives counted for little compared to Mexico or
the Moluccas.

It was not until the 17th century that the northern Europeans
became important imperialists. Their favourite organization was
an East Indies company that combined imperialism with private
enterprise. Typically, these firms were highly capitalized joint
stock companies that traded in Asia or the Americas, maintained
military and naval forces, and established fortified trading posts
abroad. All of the northern powers had them. The English East
India Company was chartered in 1600 and its Dutch counterpart
two years later.

The Dutch East Indies Company created a Dutch Empire in Asia
at the expense of the Portuguese. The Dutch seized the Moluccas
in 1605, Malacca in 1641, Ceylon in 1658, and Cochin in 1662.

They made Jakarta the capital of their Indonesian possessions in
1619. The Dutch also seized Brazil in the 1630s and 1640s. They

19


colonized sugar islands in the Caribbean, and founded New York
in 1624 and the Cape Colony in South Africa in 1652.

The English also created an empire in the 17th century. In Asia,
the English East India Company defeated the Portuguese in the
naval battle of Swally off Surat in 1612. Subsequently, fortified
trading posts were established at Surat (1612), Madras (1639),
Bombay (1668), and Calcutta (1690). By 1647, the East India
Company had 23 establishments in India. In the Americas, a
variety    of individuals and groups established colonies. Jamestown,
Virginia, was the first success, in 1607. The legendary Plymouth
colony followed in 1620, and the much more important
Massachusetts Bay colony ten years later. The Bahamas and a
string      of islands were taken in the Caribbean in the 1620s and
1630s. Jamaica was added in 1655.

The English state actively expanded its empire – particularly at
the expense of the Dutch. The first steps were taken by Oliver
Cromwell, during the Commonwealth (1640–60), and continued
after  the Restoration. Expenditure on the navy was greatly
increased. The first Navigation Act was passed in 1651. This
mercantilist measure was intended to exclude the Dutch from
trading   with the English empire. The first Anglo-Dutch War
(1652–4) was fought for commercial advantage, but was far from
successful. After the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, the
Navigation  Acts were reinstated and extended, the (now Royal)
Navy   was expanded, and more wars were fought against the Dutch
in 1665–7 and 1672–4. New York was seized in 1664. English
colonies were established along the American coast from Georgia
to Maine. Their economies grew rapidly by exporting tobacco,
rice, wheat, and meat to England and the Caribbean. By 1770, the
population of British America had reached 2.8 million, or almost
half   of England’s.

English and Dutch trade with their colonies drove their economies
forward. Cities and export-oriented manufacturing grew. The

occupational structure changed accordingly. Table 3 divides the
populations of the main European countries into three groups:
agricultural, urban, and rural non-agricultural. In the Middle
Ages,   about three-quarters of the population was engaged in
farming, most manufacturing was carried out in cities, and the
‘rural non-agricultural population’ consisted of village craftsmen,
priests, carters, and the servants of country houses. In 1500, Italy
and Spain were the most advanced economies, with the largest
cities that produced the best manufactures. The Low Countries
(principally modern-day Belgium) were an extension of this
economy.  The Dutch population was very small, and England was
little more than a sheep walk.

By the eve of the Industrial Revolution, there had been far-
reaching changes. England was the most transformed country.
The fraction of the population in agriculture had dropped to 45%.
England was the most rapidly urbanizing country in Europe.

London grew from 50,000 in 1500 to 200,000 in 1600 to
500,000 in 1700 and, finally, to one million in 1800. The ‘rural
non-agricultural share’ of the population was 32% in 1750. Most
of    these people were engaged in manufacturing industries, and
their products were shipped across Europe and, sometimes,
around the world. Artisans in Witney, Oxfordshire, for instance,
sold blankets to the Hudson Bay Company, which swapped them
for fur with the natives of Canada. The economy of the Low
Countries developed along similar lines. The Netherlands were
even more urbanized than England and also had large, export-
oriented rural industries.

The rest of Europe was much less transformed. The great
continental countries saw a small reduction in the share of their
populations in agriculture and a corresponding increase in rural
industry with little extra urbanization. Spain and Italy look
stationary, with no change in the distribution of their
populations.

23


Spain was particularly unlucky. In the 16th century, it looked like
the most successful imperialist, for Latin America yielded so
much silver. Silver imports, however, led to much greater
inflation  in Spain than elsewhere. As a result, Spanish
agriculture   and manufacturing became uncompetitive. The
constancy   in the share of the urban population in Spain masks
great changes – the populations of old industrial cities collapsed
while Madrid expanded on the basis of American loot.

Globalization spurred northwestern Europe forward but held
southern Europe back.

Success in the global economy had major implications for
economic development, including:

First, the growth in urbanization and rural manufacturing
increased the demand for labour and led to tight labour markets
and high wages. Living standards were high in London and
Amsterdam (Figure 3).

Second, growing cities and a high-wage economy put great
demands on agriculture for food and labour. The result was
agricultural revolutions in both England and the Netherlands.
Output   per farm worker increased by about 50% in both countries
and reached the highest levels in Europe.

Third, growing urban demand also led to energy revolutions in
both England and the Netherlands. In the Middle Ages, charcoal
and firewood were the principal fuels burned in cities. As the cities
grew, wood prices skyrocketed, and substitute fuels were
developed.  In the Netherlands, the alternative was peat; in
England,    it was coal. Coal was mined in Durham and
Northumberland and shipped down the coast to London. England
was     the only country in the world with a large coal-mining
industry in the 18th century, and that also gave it access to the
cheapest energy in the world, as Figure 6 indicates.

Fourth, the high-wage economy generated a high level of
literacy, numeracy, and skill formation in general. Table 4 shows
estimates of literacy (measured by the ability to sign one’s

name rather than make a mark) in 1500 and 1800. Literacy
rose everywhere in Europe, but the growth was greatest in

northwestern Europe. The Reformation does not explain the rise,
as is often assumed, for literacy was as high in northeastern
France, Belgium, and the Rhine Valley – all Catholic areas – as in
the Netherlands or England. The rise in literacy was due to the
high-wage, commercial economy. The expansion of commerce and
manufacturing increased the demand for education by making it
economically valuable; at the same time, the high-wage economy
provided parents with the money to pay for schooling their
children.

Chapter 3

The Industrial Revolution

The Industrial Revolution (roughly 1760 to 1850) was a turning
point in world history, for it inaugurated the era of sustained
economic growth. The Revolution was not the abrupt
discontinuity   that its name suggests but was the result of the
transformations of the early modern economy discussed in the
last    chapter. The rate of economic growth achieved in the century
after 1760 (1.5% per year) was very low by the standards of recent
growth miracles in which GDP has grown by as much as 8–10%
per year. However, Britain was continuously extending the
world’s technology frontier, and that is always slower going than
catching up to the leader by importing its technology, which is
how countries have grown very rapidly. Moreover, the great
achievement of the British Industrial Revolution was that it led to
continuous growth, so that income compounded to the mass
prosperity   of today.

Technological change was the motor of the Industrial Revolution.
There were famous inventions like the steam engine, the machines
to spin and weave cotton, and the new processes to smelt and
refine iron and steel using coal instead of wood fuels. In addition,
there were a host of simpler machines that raised labour
productivity in unglamorous industries like hats, pins, and nails.
There   was also a range of new English products, many of which,
like Wedgwood porcelain, were inspired by Asian manufactures.

27


In the 19th century, engineers extended the 18th-century
mechanical inventions across the board. The steam engine was
applied   to transportation with the invention of the railway and the
steamship. Power-driven machinery, whose use was initially
restricted   to textile mills, was applied to industry generally.

The question is: why was the revolutionary technology invented in
England rather than the Netherlands or France or, for that matter,
China or India?

Cultural and political context

The Industrial Revolution took place in a particular political and
cultural context that was favourable to innovation, and that may
help  to explain it.

The English constitution has been a model for European liberals
and modern economists alike. It was far from democratic: only
3–5% of the English could vote and even fewer of the Scots. Much
power remained with the Crown – in particular, the power to
make war and peace. While Parliament had a constitutional right
to refuse funds for war, it never did.

The English constitution had many features that promoted
economic growth, although they were not the ones stressed by
modern economists, who emphasize restrictions on taxation and
the security of property. Parliamentary supremacy actually
resulted in the reverse. While French monarchs claimed to be
absolute, they could not increase taxes without consent, and it was
a  crisis in public finances that precipitated the Revolution by
forcing Louis XVI to convene the États généraux in 1789. The
nobility  in France were exempt from taxation, but the English
Parliament introduced a land tax in 1693 that was imposed on
peers    as well as commoners. Most tax revenue, however, was
raised from excise duties on consumer goods like beer and imports
like sugar and tobacco. These taxes were borne primarily by

28


workers, who were not represented in Parliament. Parliament may
have checked the Crown, but, in the absence of democracy, who
checked Parliament?

In the event, the English state collected about twice as much per
person as the French state and spent a larger fraction of the
national income. It is arguable that these expenditures promoted
economic growth. Most of the money was spent on the army and
the  navy. The former was occasionally directed abroad but was
always available to maintain domestic order by suppressing
assemblies opposed to machinery or in favour of democracy. The
navy  was directed to expand Britain’s empire and promote the
country’s commerce. Even the workers gained from this since
imperialism was the basis of the high-wage economy, which in
turn    led to growth by inducing labour-saving technical change.
Had Louis XIV had the power to levy taxes, he might have
advanced French prosperity by maintaining the French navy in a
permanent state of readiness rather than enlarging or contracting
it    in response to the swing between war and peace.

Growth was also promoted by Parliament’s power to take people’s
property against their wishes. This was not possible in France.

Indeed, one could argue that France suffered because property was
too secure: profitable irrigation projects were not undertaken in
Provence because France had no counterpart to the private acts of
the  British Parliament that overrode property owners opposed to
the enclosure of their land or the construction of canals or turnpikes
across it. What the Glorious Revolution meant in practice was that
the ‘despotic power’ of the state that ‘was only available
intermittently before 1688 . . . was always available thereafter’.

In addition to a favourable political system, the Industrial
Revolution was sustained by the emerging scientific culture. The
Scientific Revolution of the 17th century led to a handful of
discoveries about the natural world that were applied by inventors
in   the 18th. In addition, the success of natural philosophy lent

29


credibility to the scientific method, that is, the view that the world
is governed by laws that can be discovered by observation and
applied to the improvement of human life. Newton’s model of the
Solar System was the greatest achievement, and it inspired a
reorientation of upper-class ideas about religion and nature.

How much popular culture shared in this reorientation is an open
question. There are important examples of working-class inventors
adopting the Newtonian model. John Harrison, for instance, was
lent   a copy of Saunderson’s lectures on natural philosophy, a
Newtonian tract, by a clergyman, and made a copy of it. Did this
early interest in Newton dispose Harrison to invent the
chronometer? On the other hand, there was continued popular
enthusiasm  for witchcraft, which was the medieval alternative to
science.   It is likely that more people believed in witchcraft than in
Newton’s laws of motion. John Wesley’s preaching was attracting
millions of followers, and he was of the view that the ‘giving up of
witchcraft is, in effect, giving up the Bible’.

Popular culture was more directly transformed by social changes
than by Newton’s Principia Mathematica. The most powerful
changes were urbanization and the growth of commerce. They
encouraged the spread of literacy and numeracy by increasing
their   value. By the 18th century, most sons of craftsmen, artisans,
shop keepers, and farmers, and a smaller share of the sons of
labourers, received several years of primary education. Many girls
were also schooled. The result was a public that read newspapers
and followed politics to an unprecedented degree. It was a new
world when a radical like Tom Paine could achieve celebrity by
selling hundreds of thousands of copies of The Rights of Man.

Explaining the Industrial Revolution

Scientific discoveries were known across Europe, and upper-class
enthusiasm for natural philosophy was universal. These cultural
developments, therefore, cannot explain why the Industrial

30


Revolution was British. Instead, the explanation lies in Britain’s
unique structure of wages and prices. Britain’s high-wage,
cheap-energy economy made it profitable for British firms to
invent and use the breakthrough technologies of the Industrial
Revolution.

In Chapters 1 and 2, we saw that wages in Britain were sufficiently
high for most people to eat bread, beef, and beer, instead of
subsisting on oatmeal. More to the point, so far as technology is
concerned, British wages were high relative to the price of capital
(Figure  7). In the late 1500s, the wage rate relative to the price of
capital services was similar in southern England, France, and
Austria, which are representative of continental Europe. By the
middle  of the 18th century, however, labour relative to capital was
60% more expensive in England than on the continent. In the
early 19th century, which is the first time a comparison can be
made with Asia, labour was even cheaper relative to capital in
India than it was in France or Austria. The incentive to mechanize
production was correspondingly less in India.

It was the same story with energy. Britain, especially on the coal
fields in the north and in the midlands, had the cheapest energy in
the world. Consequently, energy was much cheaper compared to
labour in Britain than it was anywhere else.

As a result of these differences in wages and prices, businesses in
England found it profitable to use technology that saved on
expensive labour by increasing the use of cheap energy and
capital. With more capital and energy at their disposal, British
workers became more productive – the secret of economic growth.
In Asia and Africa, the cheapness of labour led to the opposite
result.

The cotton industry

Eric Hobsbawm famously wrote: ‘Whoever says Industrial
Revolution says Cotton.’ From tiny beginnings in the mid-18th
century,  the industry grew to be Britain’s largest, accounting for
8%    of GDP in 1830 and 16% of British manufacturing jobs. Cotton
was the first industry to be transformed by factory production. The
growth of cotton led to the explosive growth of Manchester and
many smaller cities in the north of England and Scotland. Britain’s
expansion came at the expense of India, China, and the Middle
East.  When these countries eventually began to re-industrialize,
cotton was one of the first industries they turned to.

In the 17th century, China and India had the world’s largest cotton
industries. Bengal, Madras, and Surat shipped cotton cloth across
the Indian Ocean and as far as West Africa. Cotton was also
produced in small centres across Asia and Africa. The various East
Indies companies began to ship cotton calicoes and muslins to
Europe in the late 17th century where they successfully competed
against linen and wool, the principal European textiles. Cotton
was   so successful that France prohibited its import in 1686, and
the English restricted its domestic consumption. However, there
was a large export market in West Africa, where cotton cloth was

32


bartered for slaves. In this market, English cloth competed against
Indian cloth.

International competition was the spur that led to the
mechanization of cotton spinning. The finer the cotton, the more
time    it took to spin. Wages were so high in England that
competition with India was only possible in the coarsest fabrics.
There   was a large market in finer fabrics, but England could only
compete if machines were invented to reduce labour. The stakes
were considerable: in 1750, Bengal spun about 85 million pounds
of cotton per year, while Britain managed only 3 million. There
were numerous attempts to mechanize production. James
Hargreaves’ spinning jenny, developed in the mid-1760s, was the
first commercially successful machine, followed closely by Richard
Arkwright’s water frame. Samuel Crompton’s mule, invented in
the   1770s, married the jenny and the water frame (hence its name)
and became the basis of mechanical spinning for a century.

These machines owed nothing to scientific discoveries. None
involved great conceptual leaps; instead, they required years of
experimental engineering to come up with designs that worked
reliably. Thomas Edison’s remark that ‘invention is 1% inspiration
and 99% perspiration’ is on the mark for the cotton industry.

The crux in explaining why the Industrial Revolution was
invented in Britain is, therefore, explaining why British inventors
spent  so much time and money doing R&D (Research and
Development, that is, Edison’s ‘perspiration’) to operationalize
what    were often banal ideas. The key is that the machines they
invented increased the use of capital to save labour. Consequently,
they were profitable to use where labour was expensive and capital
was cheap, that is, in England. Nowhere else were the machines
profitable. That is why the Industrial Revolution was British.

Cotton yarn was manufactured in three stages. First, the bales of
raw cotton were broken open and the dirt and debris removed.

33


Second, the cotton was carded, that is, the strands of cotton were
aligned into a loose strand called a roving by dragging the cotton
between cards studded with pins. Third, the roving was spun into
yarn. Before machines, the whorl and drop spindle was used to
make fine yarn, while the spinning wheel made coarse yarn. In
each case, the roving was stretched to thin it, then twisted to
strengthen it, and, finally, the yarn was wound on a spindle to
send    to weavers.

All of these stages were mechanized, and, indeed, Richard
Arkwright’s greatest achievement was to design a mill (Cromford
Mill  No.2) in which machines were laid out in a logical sequence,
and which became the model for the early cotton mills in Britain,
the USA, and the continent. Spinning was the crux of the
problem, and inventors had worked on it since at least the 1730s.
Lewis Paul and John Wyatt were on the right track in the 1740s
and 1750s with their system of roller spinning, but their mill in
Birmingham always lost money. James Hargreaves’ spinning
jenny,   invented in the 1760s, was the first commercially successful
spinning machine. It elaborated the spinning wheel by running
many spindles off one wheel and using draw bars and linkages to
mimic the movements of the spinner’s hands. Arkwright employed
clockmakers for five years in order to perfect his water frame that
used  rollers. With roller spinning, the roving was stretched by
pulling it through successive pairs of rollers, which, like mangles,
dragged the cotton forward. Each pair of rollers moved faster than
the previous, so they lengthened and thinned the yarn by pulling
against each other.

Crompton’s mule was the last great spinning machine. It
combined the draw bars of Hargreaves’ jenny with the rollers of
Arkwright’s water frame to make a machine that could spin yarn
far   finer than any of the other machines. The jenny and the water
frame made England competitive with Indian producers in coarse
yarn; the mule made England the low-cost producer in fine yarn
as well.

34


The economics of these machines were similar. All of them
reduced the hours of labour needed to produce one pound of yarn.
At  the same time, they increased the capital required per pound.
As a result, the cost saving from mechanical spinning was higher
where labour was more expensive. In the 1780s, the rate of return
to building an Arkwright mill was 40% in England, 9% in France,
and less than 1% in India. With investors expecting a 15% return
on fixed capital, it is no surprise that about 150 Arkwright mills
were erected in Britain in the 1780s, 4 in France, and none in
India. Relative profitability was similar with the spinning jenny, as
was the result – 20,000 jennies were installed in England on the
eve of the French Revolution, 900 in France, and none in India.

There was no point in spending much time or money to invent
mechanical spinning in France or India since it was not profitable
to   use it there.

The situation did not remain like this, which is why the Industrial
Revolution spread to other countries. Arkwright’s mills created an
integrated series of machines that cut costs by more than
Hargreaves’  jenny. Crompton’s mule cut the cost of spinning fine
yarn.    A long list of inventors improved the mule over the next half
century. They economized on capital as well as on labour. By the
1820s, improved cotton machinery could be profitably installed on
the continent, and by the 1850s, it proved profitable to install even
more improved machinery in low-wage economies such as Mexico
and India. By the 1870s, factory cotton production began to shift
into the Third World.

The steam engine

The steam engine was the most transformative technology of the
Industrial Revolution since it allowed mechanical power to be used
in    a wide range of industries as well as in railways and ocean ships.

Steam power was a spin-off of the Scientific Revolution.
Atmospheric pressure was one of the hot topics of 17th-century

35


physics. It was investigated by famous scientists across Europe,
including Galileo, Torricelli, von Guericke, Huygens, and Boyle.
By   the middle of the century, Huygens and von Guericke had
shown that, if a vacuum was created in a cylinder, then the
pressure  of the atmosphere would force a piston into it. In 1675,
the Frenchman Denis Papin used this idea to make a crude, proto
steam engine. A practical engine was completed by Thomas
Newcomen in 1712 in Dudley, after 12 years of experimentation.
Newcomen’s engine involved boiling water to make steam, filling a
cylinder with it, and then injecting cold water into the cylinder to
condense the steam so that the pressure of the atmosphere
depressed   a piston into the cylinder. The piston was connected to
a  rocker beam that raised a pump as the piston was depressed.

The steam engine emphasizes the importance of economic
incentives in inducing invention. The science of the engine was
pan-European, but the R&D was conducted in England because
that     was where it paid to use the steam engine. The purpose of
the Newcomen engine was to drain mines, and Britain had many
more mines than any other country due to the large coal industry.
In addition, the early steam engines burned vast quantities of
coal, so they were cost-effective only where energy was cheap.

John Theophilus Desaguliers wrote in the 1730s that

the Newcomen engines were ‘now of general use . . . in the

Coal-Works, where the Power of the Fire is made from the Refuse
of the Coals, which would not otherwise be sold’. They were
scarcely used anywhere else. Despite the scientific breakthroughs,
the steam engine would not have been developed had the British
coal industry not existed.

Steam power became a technology that could be applied to many
purposes and used around the world, but only after the engine
was improved. This was not accomplished before the 1840s.

Engineers like John Smeaton, James Watt, Richard Trevithick,
and Arthur Woolf studied and modified the engine, reducing its
energy requirements and smoothing its delivery of power. Coal

36


consumption per horse power-hour of power was cut from

44 pounds in the Newcomen engines of the 1730s to one pound in
the triple expansion marine engines of the late 19th century. The
genius of British engineering undid the country’s competitive
advantage by improving its technology to the point that it could be
profitably used around the globe. This allowed the Industrial
Revolution  to spread abroad and the whole world to industrialize.

Continuing invention

The greatest achievement of the Industrial Revolution was that
the 18th-century inventions were not one-offs like the
achievements of earlier centuries. Instead, the 18th-century
inventions kicked off a continuing stream of innovations.

Cotton continued to be a focus of effort. While the 18th-century
inventions had turned spinning into a factory system, weaving was
still  done on hand looms in cottages. This was changed by the
Reverend Edmund Cartwright, who spent decades and wasted his
fortune perfecting a power loom. He was inspired by automatons
like Jacques de Vaucanson’s mechanical duck that wowed the
court  in Versailles by flapping, eating, and defecating! (Voltaire
quipped: ‘Without Vaucanson’s duck, you have nothing to remind
you   of the glory of France.’) If a mechanism could poop like that,
couldn’t it also do useful work? Cartwright thought so and
patented   his first loom in 1785 and an improved version in 1792. It
was  not commercially viable, however. Many inventors improved
it piecemeal. By the 1820s, the power loom was displacing hand
looms in England, but they continued in use until the 1850s. The
power loom greatly increased capital costs while reducing labour
costs, so its adoption was sensitive to factor prices as well as the
relative efficiency of the two methods. It is singularly important
that  the power loom was taken up more rapidly in the USA than it
was in Britain. By the 1820s, wages were already higher in the
USA, and the pattern of technological innovation reflected that
difference.

37


Cotton also led the way in the application of steam power to
factories. Experiments had been made earlier, of course. In 1784,
Boulton and Watt invested in the Albion Flour Mill, the first
large-scale steam-powered factory, to promote their engines. The
next year, steam was applied to a cotton mill for the first time.

However, most factories were driven by water power until the
1840s. It was only then that the fuel consumption of steam
engines had dropped sufficiently to make them a cheaper source
of power. After that, the use of steam to power industry expanded
continuously.

Steam power also revolutionized transportation in the 19th
century. Everyone who invented a high-pressure steam engine
(Cugnot, Trevithick, Evans) used it to power a land vehicle, but
they were all unsuccessful since they could not negotiate the
unpaved roads. One solution was to put the engine on rails. Coal
and  ore had long been hauled in carts rolling on primitive
wooden rails laid in mines. In the 18th century, iron rails
replaced wood, and the lines were extended. In 1804, Richard
Trevithick built the first steam locomotive for a railway at the
Penydarren Ironworks in Wales. From then on, colliery railways
became  the testing ground for steam locomotives. The 26-mile
Stockton and Darlington Railway (1825) was planned as a coal
railway but showed there was money to be made in carrying
general freight and passengers. The first general-purpose
railway   was the 35-mile Liverpool and Manchester Line, opened
in 1830. It was a great success and set off a frenzy of railway
promotion in Britain. Almost 10,000 kilometres of track were
open    by 1850, and 30 years later, the network reached 25,000
kilometres.

Steam power was also applied to water travel – another way of
avoiding bad roads! Invention was international from the start.
The  first working vessels were French – the Palmipède (1774) and
Pyroscaphe (1783) – and the first commercially successful ship
was   Robert Fulton’s Clermont, which plied the Hudson River from

38


1807. Two years later, John Molson, the Canadian brewer, sailed
steamships on the St Lawrence River using engines built in
Trois-Rivière, Québec.

By the middle of the 19th century, steam was displacing sail in
ocean transportation. Britain became the centre of world
shipbuilding in view of its pre-eminence in iron and engineering.
Brunel’s Great Western (1838) marked a breakthrough, for it
established that a ship could carry enough coal to cross the
Atlantic,     and his Great Britain (1843) was the first ship to be built
of   iron and to use a propeller instead of paddle wheels. It took
another half century, however, for steam to vanquish sail. The
reason  was that ships still had to carry their own coal, so they lost
much of their cargo space on long voyages. The first routes to shift
to steam were consequently short. As the coal requirements of
steam engines were reduced, ships could sail longer distances with
the same amount of coal, and the distance for which steam could
undercut sail lengthened. The last routes to fall were those from
China   to Britain where clipper ships survived until the end of the
19th century.

Steam power is an example of a general-purpose technology
(GPT), that is a technology that can be applied to a variety of uses.
Other GPTs include electricity and computers. It takes decades to
develop the potential of GPTs, so their contribution to economic
growth takes place long after their invention. That was certainly
true   for steam. As late as 1800, almost a century after Newcomen’s
invention, steam power made only a minute contribution to the
British economy. By the middle of the 19th century, however, the
potential of steam was finally being realized as it was applied
widely     to transportation and industry. Half of the growth of labour
productivity in Britain in the mid-19th century was due to steam.
This long-run pay-off is an important reason that economic
growth continued through the century. Another reason was the
growing application of science to industry, which we will consider
in   the next chapter.

Chapter 4

The ascent of the rich

Between 1815 and 1870, the Industrial Revolution spread from
Britain to the continent with remarkable success. Not only did the
West European countries catch up to the leader, but they joined
the leader in forming a group of innovators that has jointly
advanced the world’s technology frontier ever since. Of course,
North America also industrialized in the 19th century and soon
joined the innovation club. The USA, indeed, has become the
world’s technological leader, but its performance should be
thought   of as ‘first among equals’ – the latter including the West
Europeans and the British.

Whether Western Europe’s success is a surprise depends on one’s
view of the Industrial Revolution. Some historians think that the
Revolution was as likely to have happened in France or Germany
as     in Britain and that the big problem, therefore, is explaining
why it occurred in Europe rather than Asia. For them, it is obvious
that the continent would quickly industrialize. Other historians,
however, think that there were fundamental differences in
institutions  or incentives between Britain and the continent, in
which   case, the industrialization of Western Europe requires an
explanation.

Institutionalists believe that continental development in the 18th
century was held back by archaic institutions. These were swept

40


away by the French Revolution, which was exported to most of
Europe by the armies of the Republic and Napoleon. Everywhere
the French conquered, they remodelled Europe in their new
image, which included the abolition of serfdom, equality before
the  law, a new legal regime (the Code Napoléon), the expropriation
of monastic property, the creation of national markets by the
abolition of internal tariffs and erection of a common external
tariff,    a rationalized tax system, universal secular primary
education and the extension of modern secondary schools,
technical institutes and universities, the promotion of scientific
societies and culture. Countries like Prussia that were defeated by
Napoleon but not incorporated into his empire also modernized
their institutions. Napoleon’s wars prevented these reforms from
having immediate effect, but, after Waterloo, Europe was ripe for
industrial take-off.

Another line of explanation emphasizes the incentives to adopt
the new industrial technology. First, Britain’s early start meant
that British manufacturers could out-compete those on the
continent, and, second, the technology of the Industrial
Revolution  was inappropriate for continental countries where
wages  were lower and energy prices generally higher than in
Britain. Continental industrialization required the invention of
appropriate technology and protection from British competition
while  that took place.

While Britain did not have a policy to ‘industrialize’, most
countries since have had a strategy to emulate its success. In the
19th century, a package of development policies emerged that
many countries followed. These policies were originally worked
out  in the USA (see Chapter 6) and then promoted in Europe by
Friedrich List, a German who lived in the USA from 1825 to 1832
and then returned to Germany to write The National System of
Political Economy (1841). The standard development strategy,
which built on Napoleon’s institutional revolution, had four
imperatives: create a large national market by abolishing internal

41


tariffs and improving transportation; erect an external tariff to
protect ‘infant industries’ from British competition; create banks
to stabilize the currency and provide business with capital; and,
finally, establish mass education to speed the adoption and
invention of technology. This development strategy helped
continental Europe to catch up to Britain.

Germany is a good example. In the Middle Ages, it was divided
into hundreds of independent political units. The number was
whittled down to 38 at the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Prussia,
which was the largest German state, instituted universal primary
education in the 18th century. Other states followed. By the
middle    of the 19th century, primary education was close to
universal across Germany.

Prussia also took the lead in creating a national market by forming
the Zollverein (customs union) in 1818 to unify its territory. Other
German states gradually joined. The Zollverein both abolished
internal traffics and created a common external tariff to keep out
British manufactures. The economic union formed the basis of the
German Empire created in 1871.

The integration of markets was reinforced by building railways.
The first German railway (6 kilometres long) was built from
Nuremberg to Fürth in 1835, just five years after the Liverpool to
Manchester Railway. Mainline railways were laid out in the 1850s
and branch lines in the next decades. About 63,000 kilometres
were open in 1913.

Investment banks, which played no role in British
industrialization, were prominent on the continent. The earliest
experiment   was the Société Générale pour favoriser l’Industrie
Nationale  des Pays-Bas founded in 1822 to promote industrial
development in the Low Countries. German private banks began
to     do the same thing. The Crédit Mobilier, established in France in
1852 to finance railways and industry, was a giant step forward.

42


The following year, it spun off the Bank of Darmstadt, which
popularized the joint-stock investment bank in Germany. By 1872,
all   of the giant German banks (Commerzbank, Dresdner,
Deutsche, etc.) were founded. They had many branches to
assemble   the capital of many depositors. They formed lasting
relationships with industrial clients, providing them with

long-term funds as current account overdrafts at low rates of
interest. Often these loans were secured with mortgages on
industrial property, and bank representatives served as directors
of   the industrial firms. These banks financed the great expansion
of German industry between 1880 and the First World War.

Between 1815 and 1870, all of the major industries of the
Industrial Revolution were established on the continent on a
profitable basis. Spinning jennies and early Arkwright mills had
not been profitable in France before the Revolution, but
subsequent technical progress cut the cost of producing coarse
yarn   by 42% by the mid-1830s. These cost declines made the
new-style mills profitable to erect. By 1840, France was spinning
54,000 tons of cotton per year, compared to Britain’s 192,000.
Production had begun in Germany (11,000 tons) and Belgium
(7,000).  It is worth noting that the USA at this time was already
processing 47,000 tons of raw cotton.

A modern iron industry was also established on the continent by
1870. Charcoal was the fuel used to smelt and purify iron before
the 18th century. Charcoal was replaced by coke, a refined form of
coal, in one of the most famous innovations of the Industrial
Revolution. This technique was put into practice by Abraham
Darby    at the Coalbrookdale Iron Company in 1709. Coke iron,
however, was not cost-effective in the manufacture of rolled iron
products (bars, plates, rails) until after 1750, so its early use was
limited  to a specialized casting process patented by Darby.

Between 1750 and 1790, coke iron replaced charcoal iron in
making rolled products. Coke iron was still too expensive to oust
charcoal smelting on the continent, however, for countries like

43


France were endowed with extensive forests providing cheap
charcoal and suffered from scarce and expensive coal. It took a
further  50 years of improvement in blast furnace design to raise
the productivity of coke furnaces sufficiently for them to out-
compete charcoal in continental Europe. That transition occurred
rapidly in the 1860s as French and German firms built blast
furnaces  of the most advanced design. They leapt, in other words,
to  the cutting edge of iron technology since that was the only form
of the technology that was competitive there.

Likewise, the continent did not lag behind Britain in the new
industries of the mid-19th century. Western Europe built railways,
and Europe’s locomotives were as advanced as Britain’s. The same
was true of steel. Before 1850, steel was an expensive – and minor
– product of the iron industry, which mainly produced plates and
rails from wrought iron refined from pig iron in the puddling
furnace. The technical problem in steel production was to melt
pure  pig iron, so that the addition of other elements including
carbon could be precisely controlled. A temperature in excess of
1500° C was required. The first solution was the converter,
invented independently around 1850 by Henry Bessemer and
William Kelly. An alternative solution was pioneered by Sir Carl
Wilhelm Siemens, who built a regenerative furnace in the 1850s
that could reach very high temperatures. In 1865, Pierre-Émile
Martin used the Siemens furnace to melt pig iron to make steel.
The so-called open hearth furnace proved superior to the
Bessemer converter in the production of plates, sheets, and
structural shapes, and became the dominant technology until it
was superseded by the basic oxygen process in the 1960s. The
important point is that the four inventors of mass-produced steel
were  an Englishman, an American, a German living in England,
and a Frenchman. There was no international lag there.

While Western Europe had overcome its most glaring
technological deficiencies by 1870, production levels on the
continent  were still far behind those of Britain. This changed by

44


the First World War, however, as both Western Europe and the
USA overtook Britain in manufacturing. In 1880, Britain
produced 23% of the world’s manufactures, while France,
Germany,  and Belgium together produced only 18%. By 1913, the
three continental countries had out-paced Britain as their share
rose to 23% and Britain’s share dropped to 14%. At the same time,
the North American share grew from 15% to 33% of world
manufacturing. Britain did best in the cotton textile industry,
processing 869,000 tons of raw cotton per year in 1905–13,
against    the USA which reached 1,110,000 tons, Germany
435,000,  and France 231,000. British performance was far
weaker    in heavy industry. In 1850–4, Britain smelted 3 million
tons   of pig iron versus 245,000 in Germany and about 500,000 in
the USA. By 1910–13, Britain was producing 10 million tons, while
Germany smelted 15 million, and the USA 24 million.

The changes in manufacturing production had important political
implications. In the middle of the 19th century, Britain was the
‘workshop  of the world’, producing most of the world’s exported
manufactures. The USA and Germany, in particular, increased
their  production of manufactures by increasing their exports, and
the changes in trade performance were widely discussed. Britain
continued to hold its own in selling to its empire, and the value of
empire demonstrated in that way led to a scramble for colonies
among the industrial economies. Germany’s overtaking of Britain
in steel production had implications for armaments manufacture.
The Anglo-German trade rivalry stoked international tensions in
the approach to the First World War.

Not only did continental Europe and North America overtake
Britain in industrial output between 1870 and 1913, but they
manifestly joined it in technological competence. The USA,
indeed, surpassed Britain, becoming the world’s technological
leader. In most industries, however, important discoveries were
made in all of the leading industrial economies. From the
global perspective, what is striking is the difference between

45


the rich countries, who, as a group, pushed technology forward,
and the rest of the world, which seemingly made no
innovations  at all.

An important feature of the late 19th century was the
development of entirely new industries – automobiles, petroleum,
electricity, chemicals. All of the rich countries were involved in
creating these industries. The first vehicle powered by a gasoline
engine was built by Siegfried Marcus, an Austrian, in 1870. He
also invented a magneto ignition system and rotating brush
carburettor that have become standards. Karl Benz built the first
practical automobile in 1885, closely followed by Gottlieb Daimler
and Wilhelm Maybach. They were Germans. William Lanchester
built the first British auto in 1895 and invented the disc brake and
electric starter. The first company organized expressly to
manufacture autos was Panhard et Levassor in France in 1889.

They also invented the four-cylinder engine. Renault introduced
drum brakes in 1902. In 1903, Jacobus Spijker of the Netherlands
built the first four-wheel-drive racing vehicle. Automobiles
required  a range of innovations covering engines, starting systems,
brakes, transmissions, suspensions, electrics, and so forth. The
modern auto is the result of inventions made by people in all of
the leading industrial countries. By 1900, all of the industrial
countries had firms manufacturing autos. Innovation was a
collective activity among them.

Another feature of the new industries was that many were related
to developments in the natural sciences. Countries with strong
university programmes in these areas reaped economic benefits.
Germany is the pre-eminent example before the 1930s. Its
physicists  and chemists won many Nobel Prizes. Key technical
personnel in industry were trained in universities, and their
academic staff made important discoveries that improved
industrial processes and led to new products. Fritz Haber’s
discovery   of the process to convert atmospheric nitrogen to
ammonia, made when he was at the University of Karlsruhe and

46


for which he received a Nobel Prize, is one of the most famous, but
far from unique.

Hitler, the Second World War, and post-war division derailed
German science. The lead in university research passed to the
USA, which had been developing a very large higher education
sector. University research in the USA floated on a sea of
government money. This was directed towards the military during
the  Cold War, but many of the projects brought benefits to the
economy as a whole. Funding was also directed towards medicine,
space exploration, and even the humanities and social sciences.

This funding underpinned America’s global leadership.

The macro-economic character of technological
progress

Most R&D has been carried out in today’s rich countries. They
have developed technologies that they anticipated would be
profitable. Therefore, the new products and processes that they
pioneered were addressed to their needs and suited to their
circumstances; in particular, the high wages of rich countries
induced   them to invent products that economized on labour by
increasing the use of capital. This led to an ascending spiral of
progress: high wages induced more capital-intensive production
that,  in turn, led to higher wages. This spiral underlies the rising
incomes of rich countries.

A consequence of Western Europe and the USA doing all of the
world’s R&D is that there is a world ‘production function’ that
defines  the technological options of all countries. A ‘production
function’ is the mathematical relationship that indicates how much
GDP  a country can produce with its labour and capital. Figure 8
shows the world production function by plotting GDP per worker
against capital per worker for 57 countries in 1965 and 1990. The
points bracket the function. It has the feature that more capital per
worker translates into more output per worker. Moreover, the

relationship flattens out at high levels of capital per worker because
of the law of diminishing returns: more and more capital yields
less and less additional output. Finally, different icons are used for
the 1965 and the 1990 data. A country with $10,000 of capital per
worker produced no more output in 1990 than it did in 1965. It
experienced no technical progress, in other words. The change in
the   world’s technology consisted in getting more output per worker
by pushing capital per worker to levels higher than those reached
before. The beneficiaries of these improvements were the rich
countries operating with highly capital-intensive technologies in
1965. These were also the countries that invented the new
technologies of 1990. These improvements did not automatically
trickle  down to poorer countries.

For some of these countries, we can measure output per worker
and capital per worker back to the Industrial Revolution. With
these data, we can compare what has happened over time to what
happens across space. For instance, the line in Figure 9 labelled
‘USA’ connects the points representing capital per worker and

48


output per worker for the USA from 1820 to 1990. The trajectory
of the USA’s development follows the same pattern as rich and
poor countries in 1965 and 1990. It is the same story for all other
rich countries: growth over time looks like differences across
space today. Figure 10 shows this for Italy, and Figure 11 for
Germany. There are some idiosyncrasies in these histories – the
USA,  as befits the world’s technological leader, has usually got a
bit more output from its capital and labour than other countries,
while Germany, perhaps because of the importance of investment
banks, has accumulated more capital per worker – but the
fundamental dynamics are the same. The correspondence
between   growth over time and differences across space is a direct
consequence of the fact that the technological possibilities in the
world  today were created by the rich countries as they developed.

The reason that poor countries are poor is because they use
technology that was developed by rich countries in the past. The
most successful industry of many developing countries is the
manufacture of clothing. The key technology is the sewing
machine.   The treadle sewing machine was first produced
commercially in the 1850s, and the electric sewing machine was

introduced in 1889. Export success in most developing countries
today is based on 19th-century technology.

The statistics in Figure 8 make the same point. Why is Peru
relatively poor? In 1990, capital per worker in Peru was $8,796
and output per worker was $6,847. These figures are almost

50


identical to Germany’s in 1913: $8,769 and $6,425, respectively.
Less capital today throws you further back in time. In 1990, for
instance, Zimbabwe had $3,823 of capital per worker, and each
worker produced $2,537 per year. Not bad for 1820. Malawi had

$428 of capital, and GDP per worker was $1,217 – about the same
as India early in the 19th century, and considerably below the
levels realized in the UK, USA, and Western Europe at the same
time. Even in 1990, capital per worker in India had increased only
to $1,946 and output per worker had reached $3,235 – putting
India on a par with Britain in 1820.

The obvious question is why Peru, Zimbabwe, Malawi, and India
do not adopt the technology of the Western countries and become
rich themselves. The answer is that it would not pay. Western
technology in the 21st century uses vast amounts of capital per
worker.   It only pays to substitute that much capital for labour
when wages are high relative to capital costs. This is shown in all
Figures by the flattening out of the relationship between output
per worker and capital per worker. When capital per worker is
high, it takes a lot more capital per worker to increase output per
worker by $1,000 than is required when capital per worker is low.
Labour has to be very expensive to make it worthwhile to build all
that extra capital. The Western countries have experienced a
development trajectory in which higher wages led to the invention
of labour-saving technology, whose use drove up labour
productivity and wages with it. The cycle repeats. Today’s poor
countries missed the elevator. They have low wages and high
capital  costs, so they make do with archaic technology and low
incomes.

Industrial history provides examples of these principles. In the
last chapter, we discussed the invention of the power loom and the
way it was brought into use in the USA – a very high-wage country
– and then in Britain, once it was perfected. The power loom was
never cost-effective in low-wage countries, where people
continued  to weave with hand looms. Their situation became even

51


more difficult later in the 19th century when the USA became the
economic leader with the highest wage economy. American
technology reflected that circumstance. In the 1890s, an English
immigrant named James Henry Northrop made a series of
inventions that resulted in a fully automatic loom. It greatly
increased labour productivity but required substantial investment.
These looms were profitable to install in America where wages
were very high, but they were too expensive to use in Britain –
even though Britain was a high-wage economy by world
standards. The Northrop loom was even less appropriate in poor
countries. The process of technical change, in which inventors in
the leading economies sought to save high-wage labour, resulted
in machinery that further increased the competitive advantage of
rich countries without conferring any advantage on the poor
countries of the world.

Chapter 5

The great empires

To the east of Europe were empires. The Ottoman Turks
conquered Constantinople in 1453, and their rule extended from
the Balkans, to the Middle East and North Africa. The writ of the
Russian Tsar ran from Poland to Vladivostok. The Persian Empire,
under different dynasties, lasted for thousands of years. Much of
India was governed by the Mughal emperors in the 17th and 18th
centuries. Japan had an emperor from the 3rd century CE
onwards,   and parts of South Asia such as Cambodia and Thailand
had advanced states from an early date. China was the greatest
empire of all and had existed for thousands of years.

Europeans have been aware of the riches of Asia for millennia,
and that was one reason they tried to sail there. Marco Polo’s
account of his 13th-century journey to China was popular, and
Columbus annotated his personal copy. Jean-Baptiste Du Halde’s
Description de la Chine (1736), based on Jesuit missionary
accounts, painted a glowing picture of Chinese civilization. It was
widely read and debated.

Not everyone accepted that the East was prosperous, however.
Leading the doubters were the classical economists Adam Smith,
Robert Malthus, and Karl Marx. They agreed that Europe was
richer and had better prospects for growth. Each explained
China’s hypothesized backwardness with his own pet theory – for

53


Smith, the problem was the state prohibition on foreign trade and
a suspected insecurity of private property; for Malthus, it was
universal marriage that resulted in high fertility and consequently
low incomes; for Marx, it was a pre-capitalist social structure that
failed to sustain individual initiative.

These views became widely accepted, but have been challenged in
recent years by the California School of economic history – so
called because its proponents are professors at California
universities. According to the California School, China’s legal
system    was comparable to Europe’s and property was secure, the
Chinese family system kept the fertility rate low so that the
population grew no more rapidly in China than in Europe,
markets    for commodities and for land, labour, and capital were as
evolved as those in Europe. As a result, productivity and living
standards were similar at both ends of Eurasia. The reason that
the Industrial Revolution happened in Europe does not, therefore,
lie in institutional or cultural differences but rather in the
continent’s accessible coal reserves and gains from globalization.

This re-interpretation has been widely debated for both China and
for other empires. Most doubtful is the suggestion that the
advanced parts of China like the Yangzi Delta had incomes as high
as  those of England and the Netherlands (Figure 3). On the other
hand, the positive assessment of Chinese markets and institutions
gains credence since reassessments of other empires (such as that
of Rome) have come to similar conclusions, and the California
School is right that the Industrial Revolution happened in Britain
because of coal and commerce. What is notable about Asian
history   is the absence of such triggers.

Globalization and de-industrialization

Few of the great empires had a good 19th century. India formally
became a British colony after the Mutiny of 1857. The Chinese,
Ottoman, and Russian emperors were overthrown by the 1920s.

54


The great empires started the 19th century with the largest
manufacturing industries in the world and ended the century with
these industries destroyed and without modern factory industries
to replace them. The only – and partial – exceptions were Russia
and Japan.

Three factors drove economic success and failure between
Waterloo and the Second World War – technology, globalization,
and state policy.

The Industrial Revolution in the West drove Asian manufacturers
out of business for two reasons. First, manufacturing became
more productive in Europe, cutting costs there. Industrial
technology, however, was not cost-effective in other parts of the
world  where wages were lower. There was no point, for instance,
in  the Indians trying to compete against English textiles by using
spinning machines since they increased the capital costs of
spinning   in India more than they lowered the labour costs. Asian
producers either had to hope that the British would improve
spinning machines sufficiently to make them cost-effective in Asia
(which eventually did happen) or redesign the machines to adapt
them to their own circumstances (which is what Japan did).

Second, steamships and railways made international competition
more intense. As transportation costs fell, the world economy
became more and more tightly integrated, and Western firms
using power-driven machinery were able to out-compete
producers using handicraft methods from Casablanca to Canton –
despite the great difference in wages. As manufacturing
disappeared  in Asia and the Middle East, their labour forces were
redeployed into agriculture, and these continents became
exporters    of wheat, cotton, rice, and other primary products. They
became, in other words, modern underdeveloped countries.

These developments were not due to a conspiracy among the rich
nor simply to colonialism (although it played a role). They were

55


the result of one of the fundamental principles of economics –
comparative advantage. According to this theory, countries that
trade   with each other specialize in the production of commodities
that they can produce relatively efficiently. They export those
goods and import the ones that they produce relatively
inefficiently. Suppose India, for instance, were cut off from the rest
of    the world. The only way to increase its consumption of cotton
cloth would be by reducing employment in farming and shifting
the workers to spinning and weaving. The efficiency of labour in
these activities would determine how much wheat had to be given
up to get another metre of cloth. If it became possible to trade
internationally, and if the price of cloth relative to wheat in the
world   market was less than the ratio implied by domestic
production techniques, then Indians would have found it
advantageous   to export wheat and import cloth rather than
producing    the cloth themselves. They would, in other words, have
become farmers rather than manufacturers. This reconfiguration
brought short-run prosperity at the cost of long-run development.

Before Vasco da Gama reached Calicut, market connections
between Europe and Asia were tenuous. Each continent was
effectively ‘cut off from the rest of the world’. This isolation
evaporated with the development of the square-rigged sailing
ship,  global navigation, the steamship, the Suez Canal, the
railway, the telegraph, the Panama Canal, the automobile, the
aeroplane, the container ship, the telephone, the motorway, the
Internet. All of these have reduced the costs of international

transactions, integrated markets, and brought countries into more
intense competition with each other. The principle of comparative
advantage has come more powerfully into play, and the differences
in  the relative efficiency of production have become of greater and
greater moment in determining the wealth of nations. The result
has been the ‘underdevelopment’ of the Third World.

Government policy was the third factor affecting economic
performance after Waterloo. The USA and Western Europe met

56


the challenge of cheap British imports with the standard
development strategy of internal improvements, external tariffs,
investment banks, and universal education. Colonies were not in a
position to entertain such a strategy since their economic policies
were subordinated to the interests of the colonial power.

Independent states had the option of pursuing national
development, although not all of them made the effort or
succeeded in it.

Cotton textiles

We can see these themes in action in the history of cotton textile
production in India and Britain. The productivity of cotton
production  in Britain rose during the Industrial Revolution as
machinery was perfected. An increase in British manufacturing
productivity that was not matched by an equal increase in India
was bound to increase the competitiveness of English cotton
manufacturers while reducing the competitiveness of Indian
manufacturers, according to the principle of comparative
advantage. Conversely, India’s comparative advantage in the
production of agricultural goods should have increased, while
England’s declined. Comparative advantage implies that the
unbalanced productivity growth of the Industrial Revolution
should  have furthered industrial development in England, while
de-industrializing India. And that is what happened.

The shift of comparative advantage occurred in an age of falling
transport costs, which intensified the ramifications. Transport
costs declined as the efficiency of ships improved and because of
increased competition on the sea routes from Europe to India. In
the  18th century, this trade was dominated by the English and
Dutch East Indies companies. While their appearance in the early
17th century had shattered Portuguese control of the pepper trade
and led to a fall in its price in Europe, the British Navigation Acts
kept the Dutch out of the English market and checked further
competition. The Fourth Anglo-Dutch War (1780–4) was the final

57


blow: the Dutch company was so weakened that its charter was
allowed to expire in 1800. Finally, the English company lost its
trading monopoly in 1813. The resulting increase in competition
led  to falling transport costs between India and Europe.

The effect of unbalanced productivity growth and declining
shipping costs shows up in the histories of cotton prices in
England   and India. In 1812, a group of English cotton
manufacturers  met to oppose the extension of the East India
Company’s   trade monopoly. They prepared a memorandum that
showed 40-count yarn cost 43 pence per pound to spin in India
but  only 30 pence in England. The conclusion was that India was
a great potential market for British products if only competition
were allowed. They were right. It is remarkable, however, that
they could not have made this argument even ten years earlier,
since at that time British 40-count yarn cost 60 pence per pound.
The technology of 1802 was not sufficiently productive to
undercut India. The machines of 1812 could do that. The
machines continued to be improved, and by 1826, the price of

40-count yarn had dropped to 16 pence. At that price, not even
the poorest woman in India found it worthwhile to spin, and
Indian production of cotton yarn evaporated until mechanized
factories were set up in the 1870s.

The story was repeated with weaving, but the results were not
quite as catastrophic for India. Technological progress drove down
the price of English calico, as discussed in Chapter 4. From the
mid-1780s, English cloth was always cheaper in England than
Indian   cloth. Their prices could not drift too far apart, however,
since buyers regarded them as good substitutes for each other.

Hence, the drop in the English price after 1790 dragged the Indian
price down with it (Figure 12).

There is a gap in our Indian price series between 1805 and 1818,
but in that interval, two momentous changes occurred. First, the
difference between prices in India and England became very

small. The markets were integrated, so that developments in one
affected the other. Second, English prices fell below Indian prices.
Cloth exports from India to England dried up since there was no
longer money to be made in that direction. Instead, England
exported to India.

The impact on India was large. The country shifted from being a
major exporter to a major importer. The spinning industry was
wholly destroyed, and India imported all its cotton yarn. Weaving
output also declined, although hand-loom weaving survived on a
smaller and less remunerative scale. In Bihar, the share of the
work force in manufacturing dropped from 22% around 1810 to
9% in 1901. This was de-industrialization big time!

13. Real price of raw cotton

Every country has a comparative advantage in something. As
India lost its advantage in manufacturing, it gained an advantage
in agriculture – raw cotton, in particular. Figure 13 shows the real
price of raw cotton in Gujarat and in Liverpool from 1781 to 1913.
In the 18th century, cotton was much cheaper in India. Cotton
prices fell in Britain, as cotton cultivation in the southern USA
expanded. By the 1830s, the English and Indian markets were
integrated. While integration in the yarn and cloth markets
resulted    in declining prices that forced Indian manufacturers out
of business, the reverse was true in agriculture. The price of raw
cotton rose gradually, leading to an expansion of cultivation and
exports of raw cotton to supply the British textile industry.

In a sharp exchange before the British Parliament’s Select
Committee on East India Produce in 1840, Mr John Brocklehurst,
MP   for Macclesfield, put it to the witness Robert Montgomery
Martin that ‘the destruction of weaving in India had already taken
place’, so that ‘India is an agricultural rather than a manufacturing
country, and that the parties formerly employed in manufactures

60


are now absorbed in agriculture’. Martin, who was a critic of the
British Empire, replied:

I do not agree that India is an agricultural country; India is as much
a manufacturing country as an agricultural, and he who would seek
to reduce her to the position of an agricultural country seeks to
lower her in the scale of civilization . . . her manufactures of various
descriptions have existed for ages, and have never been able to be
competed with by any nation wherever fair play has been given to
them.

However laudable were Martin’s sentiments, the market forces
were on Brocklehurst’s side, and British industry out-competed
Indian manufacturing.

The story of Indian textiles was the story of much of the Third
World in the 19th century. Biased technical change in combination
with globalization promoted the industrialization of Western
countries while simultaneously de-industrializing the ancient
manufacturing economies of Asia. Even when nations were
independent    – the Ottoman Empire is an example – technical
change   and falling transport costs turned them into modern
underdeveloped countries. In the mid-20th century, the problem
of     Asian economic development was conceived as a problem of
modernizing ‘traditional societies’. In fact, their circumstances
were  anything but traditional. Underdevelopment was the
product  of 19th-century globalization and Western industrial
development.

Modern industry in India

Was India destined to remain a less developed country that
exported primary products and imported manufactures? Or
would  the elimination of handicraft production be followed by
industrial development as modern factories were built to take
advantage of India’s low-wage labour force? Indian history is an

61


especially important experiment in answering these questions, for
India had the benefit of British rule, British law, and British free
trade. Did they help it or hurt it?

India did experience some industrial development. The notable
successes were the jute and cotton industries. Both took advantage
of cheap Indian labour. British investors financed the growth of
jute mills in Bengal, and by the First World War, the industry was
the largest in the world, and its exports had driven British
competitors out of most markets. The cotton industry flourished
in   Bombay, and by 1913, it was processing 360,000 tons of raw
cotton per year – more than France but less than Germany. These
successes had only a negligible impact on the national economy,
however. Employment in cotton and jute mills amounted to half a
million people in 1911, or well under 1% of the labour force. The
economy remained overwhelmingly agricultural.

Industrial development required moving the economy away from
the pattern dictated by comparative advantage. The nationalist
view is that India needed the standard development policies that
helped Western Europe and the USA catch up to Britain – that is,
tariffs, investment banks, internal improvements, and universal
schools.

What is most striking about colonial rule is how little this
programme was pursued. In the 19th century, only 1% of the
Indian population was in school, and the literacy rate of the adult
population was 6%. Tariffs were low and only for revenue
purposes.  There was no banking policy to finance industry.

The initiatives undertaken by the Indian government highlight
the limitations of its policy. Regions like the Punjab were irrigated
to increase agricultural exports. Railways were promoted after the
Mutiny in 1857 to move troops around the country and to connect
interior agricultural districts to the coast to facilitate exporting
primary products. In the event, 61,000 kilometres of track were

62


laid before the First World War, giving India one of the largest rail
networks in the world. The railways did create a national market,
since goods could be shipped across India at low cost.

Building India’s railways must, however, be regarded as a missed
opportunity. Railways were huge projects that required modern
inputs   like steel rails and locomotives. Most countries ensured
that railroad building would enlarge or even create these
industries by using tariffs and procurement requirements to
channel   the orders to local firms. Instead, the colonial government
made sure that the orders went to British firms. Exports of British
engineering goods to India surged. There was, however, no

spin-off to India, and the founding of the country’s iron and
engineering industries waited until the 20th century.

Even today, agricultural employment predominates in India,
Pakistan, and Bangladesh, and this is the case in other poor
countries. Some countries that were poor in the 19th century,
however, did much better in the 20th by following the standard
strategy and also by going beyond it to effect a Big Push, as we
shall see.

Chapter 6

The Americas

The incorporation of the Americas into the global economy has
had enormous ramifications for the Old World and the New.

The native American population collapsed, and indigenous
civilizations were replaced by European. Northern Europe was
propelled towards industrialization, and the Americas themselves
exemplify the worldwide split between a rich North and a poor
South.

The different development trajectories of North and South
America run back to the colonial period and are rooted in
geography  and demography. South America contained most of the
indigenous population and had the greatest wealth. It was also
further  from Europe. These differences cumulated into the
difference  in income that we see today.

Geography mattered because it affected the ability to trade with
Europe. Trade could be good or bad for economic growth. On the
one hand, cheap British manufactures inhibited industrialization;
on the other, exporting local agricultural products powerfully
promoted settlement and farming generally, and these could be
springboards to later industrialization. North America was
favoured     in this regard. First, it was closer to Europe, which was
the  main market for colonial exports. With shipping costs high,
North Americans could profitably produce and export a wider

64


range of products than South Americans. This advantage was
reinforced by the interior geography of the continents. The
eastern seaboard of North America was broad enough and fertile
enough to support a significant economy, and the interior of the
continent could be reached by the St Lawrence, Mohawk-
Hudson,    and Mississippi Rivers. In contrast, most economic
activity   in Latin America was in the interior of Mexico and the
Andes. Rivers did not connect these regions to the coast, so the
cost   of exporting was high.

Demography was also important. The temperate climate of most
of the USA, Canada, and much of South America presented little
disease threat to Europeans, so they flourished in those regions. In
contrast, tropical diseases led to high European mortality in the
Caribbean and Amazon and depressed the growth of the
European population.

The native population was distributed unevenly across the
Americas. Most natives lived in Mexico (21 million) or the Andes
(12 million); only about 5 million lived in the USA, with only
250,000 in the original 13 colonies. The difference in population
reflected geography. Mexico and Peru were the habitats of the
natural progenitors of the main native foods – maize, beans,
squash, potatoes, and quinoa. These plants were domesticated
where they grew in the wild and, consequently, were well adapted
to those environments. In addition, farmers there cultivated them
earlier than anywhere else. Maize and beans, for instance, were
domesticated 4,700 years ago, and so there were 4,200 years for
the  Mexican population to grow in response before Cortés arrived
in 1519. Of course, maize, beans, and squash diffused widely, but
their genetics and cultivation had to be adapted to different
environments, which slowed their spread. The growing season of
maize,    for instance, had to be cut from the 120–150 days
characteristic of the tropics to about 100 days or less for it to
succeed     in colder climates, and that task was not accomplished
until about 1000 CE. Nowhere in the eastern half of the USA or

65


Canada was maize widely cultivated before that date, so the
population of eastern North America had little time to grow
before the Europeans turned up.

The arrival of Europeans was a catastrophe for the natives. A
mid-range estimate of their population in 1500 is 57 million; by
1750, it had dropped to perhaps 5 million. Much of the decline

was due to the introduction of diseases such as smallpox, measles,
influenza, and typhus for which the natives had no immunity. The
rest  was down to war, enslavement, and ill treatment by the
settlers.

The implications of this drop, which was common to all natives,
differed in North and South America because the pre-contact
populations differed in size. In Mexico, the native population
declined   by over 90%, reaching a low point of 750,000 in the
1620s. This was still three times the population on the east coast
of  the USA before European arrival. In the Andes, the native
population dropped below 600,000 after an epidemic in
1718–20.    The native population in Mexico rebounded after the
mid-17th century, reaching 3.5 million in 1800, and the native
population of the Andes reached 2 million. Despite the Spanish
immigration in the previous three centuries, the natives
comprised three-fifths of the population of these regions, and
people   of mixed race amounted to another fifth. The final fifth
were the relatively well-off whites, who ruled these colonies. This
racial and economic structure had negative implications for

long-run growth.

The situation was very different in North America because there
were few natives to begin with. The quarter-million living on the
east coast in 1500 were reduced to only 14,697 in 1890, when they
were fully enumerated in the US census for the first time. Most of
the fall occurred in the 17th century and, indeed, often before
European settlement. The Pilgrims’ landing in Massachusetts in
1620  was preceded by epidemics in 1617–19. The Pilgrims saw this

66


as God’s blessing: ‘Thus farre hath the good hand of God favored
our beginnings . . . In sweeping away great multitudes of the
natives  . . . a little more before we went thither, that he might make
room for us there.’ Fifty years of warfare eliminated the rest. High
mortality among the natives and low mortality among the settlers
meant that the American colonies became a transplantation of
England very rapidly. The obvious exceptions to this
generalization  were the southern US colonies, where the
Europeans   imported African slaves to do the hard work. But the
survival  of natives did not affect development in North America as
it  did south of the Rio Grande.

Colonial economy of North America

Settlement is the theme of the colonial history of the USA. Some
settlers, particularly in New England, were motivated by the
desire   to create their own religious autocracy rather than submit
to  the hegemony of another creed. Most settlers, however, were
motivated by economic gain, and even the Puritans expected to
earn   the same standard of living in Massachusetts that they could
have realized in England.

Settlement and exporting were closely connected in British North
America. The Canadian economist Harold Innis highlighted the
relationship with his ‘staples thesis’, which contended that the
growth   of a region like Canada was determined by the growth of
its exports – cod fish, furs, timber – to Europe. Sales of these
products provided the money to buy manufactured goods like
cloth, tools, crockery, books, and so on. These were imported from
Britain, rather than produced in the colony, since British
industries were large and realized economies of scale that meant
they could produce more efficiently than small, colonial firms.
‘The Farmers deem it better for their profit to put away [i.e.
exchange] their cattle and corn for cloathing, then to set upon
making   of cloth.’ Britain’s Navigation Acts prevented the Dutch
and  the French from supplying the colonies’ needs.

67


Staple colonies had three characteristics. First, the price of the
staple in the colony was less than its price in Europe by an amount
that equalled the transportation cost. Prices in the two markets
moved up and down together since they were linked by trade.

Second, exports amounted to a large share of colonial income,
with the remainder being support services. Third, the returns to
settlers and their capital exceeded returns in Europe by a margin
covering the costs and risks of moving to the colony.

Pennsylvania illustrates these principles. The colony was founded
in 1681 and was suited to the cultivation of wheat, which became
its staple. Pennsylvania exports competed with Irish and English
produce in the West Indies, Iberia, and the British Isles. As a
result, prices in Philadelphia and London moved up and down
together. The synchronization is apparent in Figure 14. The Seven
Years War (1756–63) and the American Revolution (1776–83)

were the exceptions that prove the rule, for trade was disrupted in
these periods, and the correlation of prices broke down. In
addition  to wheat and flour, the colony exported timber products,
ships, iron, and potash, and earned foreign exchange from its
merchant marine. Exports were important to the colony’s
economy   and amounted to about 30% of total output in 1770. The
foreign exchange earned on these sales paid for English consumer
goods.

As the economy grew, it attracted more labour from Europe. In
the 18th century, Philadelphia real wages followed the English
trend but at a higher level to compensate the colonists for the cost
of relocating to a remote wilderness (Figure 15). England and its
North American colonies were prosperous places, with wages four
to five times subsistence – in contrast to cities like Florence where
wages dropped to bare-bones subsistence at the end of the 18th
century.

The economy of New England performed less satisfactorily, as
Figure 15 suggests. In the early 18th century, wages in

Massachusetts were on a par with London but lower than in
Pennsylvania. While Massachusetts holds an iconic place in
popular    views of American history, its economy was always
precarious because it lacked an agricultural staple. An export
trade   was developed in fish, livestock, whale oil, and wood
products including ships. New Englanders also created a large
shipping industry that generated substantial foreign earnings and
annoyed the English mercantilists since it competed with the
Mother Country. These activities did not expand rapidly, so the
demand for labour in New England increased less rapidly than the
natural increase of the population. As a result, wages sagged, and
there was continual out-migration.

While the staples thesis was developed to explain Canada, the best
examples are the sugar colonies of the Caribbean. Europeans first
encountered sugar on Crusade in Palestine. After their expulsion,
production was shifted to Cyprus, and eventually, it was cultivated
on islands in the Atlantic. The Portuguese occupation of Saõ Tomé
in 1485 was a turning point, for there they pioneered cultivation
on large plantations staffed by African slaves. This system was
later introduced to Brazil and the Caribbean where it proved
immensely profitable. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Barbados,
Jamaica, Cuba, and Saint Domingue (now Haiti) were amongst
the wealthiest places in the world.

A Caribbean colony grew sugar and other crops like coffee and
exported the produce to Europe. The necessary capital and labour
were supplied by European investors and African slaves, who
proved to be a cheaper source of labour than European
immigrants. Mortality on sugar plantations was very high, and
new   slaves were so cheap that the slaves were replenished by
purchase rather than natural increase. Four million slaves were
taken   to the British West Indies, for instance, but only 400,000
were present at emancipation in 1832. The volume of exports
determined the size of the colonial economy. In Jamaica in 1832,
for instance, exports of sugar, coffee, and other tropical produce

70


added up to 41% of the island’s income. The rest was support
activities for the plantations (the production of food for the slaves,
other supplies, shipping, and transport services, the forces of law
and order, and housing for the ancillary workers) or the
consumption expenditures of the planters on domestic servants
and  country houses. The planters’ expenditures in the colony were
only a small part of their incomes, most of which was repatriated
to Britain rather than being invested in Jamaica.

Many features of the Caribbean were replicated in the southern
colonies of the future USA. The South had the valuable staples
–   rice and indigo in South Carolina, and tobacco in Virginia and
Maryland. These crops were produced on plantations initially

staffed by English indentured servants and eventually by African
slaves. The South was richer than the northern colonies and
attracted more settlers and was the destination of most slaves.

South Carolina, for instance, was first settled in 1670. However,
the settlers lacked ‘any Commodityes fit for the market of Europe
but a few Skins they purchased from the native Indians and a little
Cedar with which they helpe to fill the ship that brings the skins
for London’. In the next decades, they searched for a staple and
eventually stumbled on rice. Exports rose from 69 pounds per
head    in 1700 to 900 pounds in 1740. Imports of slaves jumped
from 275 per year to 2,000 over the same decades.

Experimentation with cultivation techniques increased land and
labour productivity by half. The social structure of coastal areas
where the rice was grown became increasingly like the Caribbean
sugar islands. Exports added up to more than 30% of total coastal
income. The economy revolved around rice as Jamaica’s revolved
around sugar. The population became overwhelmingly black.

The white population, which was half the total in the lower South,
retreated towards the interior, where family farms predominated.
While they grew their own food, they were far from self-sufficient
since they supplied the rice plantations with food and used the

71


proceeds to purchase English cloth and other consumer goods.
Virginia and Maryland worked similarly with tobacco as the
export staple.

The British colonies differed greatly in terms of economic and social
inequality. New England and the Middle Atlantic colonies were the
most egalitarian. Some slaves were present, but slavery was
unimportant in agriculture – not because of moral scruples or
technical difficulties but because slaves would not have generated
enough income to cover their cost. The abundance of land kept
down   its price and meant that most income accrued as wages, which
were necessarily widely distributed. At the other extreme were the
Caribbean colonies, where most of the population were slaves and
inequality was extreme. The colonies of the Southern USA were
intermediate cases that combined the inequality of the plantation
with     the egalitarianism of small-scale farmers on the frontier.

The economies of the North American colonies did, however,
share one advantage that bode well for their future – namely, the
literacy of white settlers was at least as high as in England, which
was near the top of the world league table (Table 4). By the
Revolution, 70% of free men in Virginia and Pennsylvania could
sign  their names, compared to 65% in England at the same time.
In New England, the rate was close to 90%, which was achieved
through state schools and mandatory attendance.

Why was literacy high in the colonies? For the same reason it was
high in England: economic advantage. The dependence of the
colonists’ standard of living on trade and foreign markets meant
that reading, writing, and calculation brought rewards. The legal
system also made literacy valuable since contracts and land titles
were written documents. The Puritans’ desire to read the Bible
may have played a role in pushing Massachusetts literacy above
that in England or Pennsylvania, but the dependence of their
economy on trade and shipping gave them a powerful economic
motive for schooling.

Colonial economy of Latin America

Different regions of Latin America followed different development
trajectories from the future USA, and none of them did as well. We
need  to distinguish (1) the Caribbean and Brazil, (2) the southern
cone (Argentina, Chile, Uruguay), and (3) Mexico and the Andes.

We have already discussed the Caribbean economies, and similar
developments occurred in Brazil, only on an expanded scale
reflecting    its greater size. It was close enough to Europe to export
sugar, which the Portuguese introduced from Saõ Tomé in the
early 16th century. Initially, the plantations were operated with
native American slaves, but Africans were soon substituted, and
the first staple boom was underway. Between 1580 and 1660,
Portugal and Spain were united. The Dutch war against Spain was
extended to Portugal, and from 1630 to 1654, the Dutch occupied
Pernambuco, the sugar-growing province of Brazil. When they
left,    they took the knowledge of sugar production with them, and
its cultivation was introduced into the Caribbean. Caribbean
producers were closer to Europe and could undercut their rivals in
Brazil: the price of sugar in Amsterdam dropped from three-
quarters of a guilder per pound in 1589 to one-quarter of a guilder
in 1688. Brazilian plantations could not compete at that price, and
the Brazilian sugar boom was over. The country’s economic
history for the next three centuries was one staple boom after the
other: gold (early 18th century), coffee (1840–1930), rubber
(1879–1912). In each case, a product was shipped to Europe, and
slaves   or settlers were brought in to cultivate it. Like sugar in the
Caribbean – but unlike the USA – Brazil’s staple booms never
turned   into modern economic growth: why not?

The southern cone of Latin America was like North America in
that it had a small native population that was killed off by disease,
warfare, and European mistreatment. The Pampas could produce
beef and wheat at least as well as Pennsylvania, but Argentina was

73


too far from Europe for that to be feasible in the colonial period.
All that Argentina could muster was a small export trade in hides.
Chile was even more remote. The economic history of these
countries began in earnest only in the middle of the 19th century,
when ships were sufficiently improved for their exports to
compete  in Europe.

The most important Spanish colonies were Mexico and the Andes.
Their histories were determined by conquest. While the North
American settlers encountered natives practising slash-and-burn
cultivation in a sparsely settled landscape, the Spanish found
dense populations, great cities, productive agriculture, political
and religious organization as hierarchical as their own, and hoards
of gold and silver. The conquistadores overthrew the Aztec and
Inca rulers and put themselves in their place. The gold and silver
were looted. The native religions were suppressed, their texts
burnt, and Catholicism established in their stead. The natives
were reduced to a subservient race whose purpose was to support
the conquerors. Hundreds of thousands of Spaniards went to
America to seek their fortunes.

The Aztecs and Incas had exploited their subjects with demands
of tribute and labour, and the Spanish did the same. Native wages
were extraordinarily low: in the 1530s, a fully employed Mexican
native would have earned only one-quarter of the cost of a
subsistence basket of goods (Figure 16). This was not enough for a
family  to survive. The abuses were so severe that in 1542 the
Spanish Crown prohibited aboriginal slavery and limited the
power   of the conquistadores.

Meanwhile, the native population collapsed, but enough survived
to make their continued exploitation worthwhile. Forced labour
was one strategy. In the 1570s, the mita, which had been an Inca
system of labour conscription, was revived to provide workers for
the silver mines at Potosi. Mexico followed Aztec precedents with
its own form of forced labour, the repartimento. The Crown also

London   Mexico

16. Wages of an unskilled labourer, Mexico and London

granted unoccupied land to Spaniards as estates called haciendas.
By the early 17th century, more than half of the agricultural land
in the valley of Mexico had been acquired by rich Spaniards in this
way. The rest of the land was owned communally by native bands,
who practised shifting cultivation. A large native population
occupying land under communal tenure had no parallel in the
North American colonies.

Another important difference from North America was geography,
which prevented Peru and Mexico from exporting agricultural
staples. It is not surprising that Peru was too far from Europe for
this  to happen. Indeed, the markets on the west coast of America
were better integrated with Asia than with Europe. The Spanish
ran galleons between Acapulco and Manila, swapping silver coins
for Chinese silk and tea. In the late 18th century, ‘numerous
French, English, and American vessels’ bought seal skins from the
natives of present-day British Columbia and sold them in China.

75


‘The price of the skins, as they rose on the coast of America, fell
enormously in China.’

Mexico is more puzzling. Vera Cruz, its port on the Caribbean, was
no further from Europe than New Orleans. The problem for
Mexico, however, was the high cost of moving goods between the
sea  and the interior plateau, which was thousands of metres in
elevation. The road from Vera Cruz to Mexico City was ‘improved’
several times – in the mid-18th century and again in 1804. Even
then, goods were carried by mules rather than wagons. This was
far  too expensive to make the import or export of farm products
profitable, and it conferred a smaller level of protection on local
manufacturing as well. Isolation was reinforced by Spanish laws
that  prohibited trade with any country but Spain and which were
intended, like their English counterparts, to reserve the colonial
market  to Spanish manufacturers.

Almost the only product that Mexico and the Andes could export
was silver. As soon as the Spanish had conquered the natives, they
searched for precious metals. The biggest discoveries were the
Potosi mine in Bolivia (1545) and the Mexican mines in Zacatecas
(1545), Guanajuato (1550), and Sombrerete (1558).

Silver had significant disadvantages as the principal export, and
they prevented Mexico and the Andes from emulating North
American development. First, silver was inflationary. The
economies     of Peru and Mexico were based on coining money, and
the  increase in their money supplies pushed prices and wages above
world levels. Wheat in Mexico, for instance, was four to ten times as
expensive as in Amsterdam. Wages in Mexico were twice those in
Italy    or India, and wages in the Andes were double Mexican levels.
These differentials were sustainable only because of the high cost of
transport, Spain’s trade restrictions, which kept out cheap imports
(although smuggling was an endless problem), and the high cost of
Spanish manufacturing itself, which was also inflated by New
World  silver. Second, silver did not generate many jobs. Mexican

76


silver mines employed 9,143 men in 1597, and Potosi employed
11,000–12,000 in 1603. Employment in the latter declined to 4,959
around  1790. These numbers were negligible compared to the
labour forces in toto and were much smaller than the numbers
involved in producing and supplying the North American farm
exports. Third, much of the income generated by silver mining
accrued  to a small circle of rich owners rather than being disbursed
over  a broad swathe of the population. Consequently, silver
contributed to exceptionally high inequality in Latin America.

Mexico was not a staple economy on the North American model. In
1800, exports amounted to only 4% of GDP. Most of the Mexican
economy had nothing to do with exports. Therefore, the distribution
of income in Mexico followed laws that were different from the
British colonies. In North America, labour and capital were drawn
into  the colony in response to export opportunities, and their returns
were set in England, where the colony had to compete for settlers
and investment. In Mexico, wages were determined by internal
factors – by coercion of the natives, by the balance of land and
labour,  and by the efficiency of the economy. The first two were most
important in the pre-1650 period of population collapse, while the
third   was decisive in the subsequent period of population growth.

Before 1650, Mexico exhibited a pattern that is common in many
pre-industrial economies: population and wages were inversely
related. When the Spanish arrived in the 1520s, the population
was very high, and wages were low (Figure 16). Indeed, the power
of the conquistadores pushed wages even lower than high
population implied. As the native population collapsed, the real
wage rose (despite attempts to coerce labour) and reached a value
of about one in the mid-17th century. At this wage, a full-time
worker could support a family at a minimal level of comfort.

After 1650, the Mexican population grew from 1–1.5 million to 6
million in 1800. Over the same period – and this is of great
importance – the inverse relationship between population and the

77


wage broke down: the wage rose to twice subsistence even though
the population was expanding. The labour supply and the wage
could both increase only if the demand for labour was growing
faster than the supply. The rise in labour demand reflected rising
productivity across the economy. Agriculture was transformed by
the integration of European crops and animals (wheat, sheep,
cattle) with the indigenous crops (maize, beans, squash, tomatoes,
chillies). Transportation was revolutionized with European
draught animals (horses and mules). Manufacturing gained
impetus through the fabrication of new products (woollen cloth)
and   the concentration of production in specialized regions that
promoted the division of labour. These were the characteristics of
English industry that made it more productive than American and
precluded manufacturing in the colonies. In contrast, the isolation
of Mexico and the Andes and the large size of their populations
made manufacturing development feasible. The expansion of the
Latin American economy, of course, took place under the sway of
Spanish rule and shows that Spain’s policies, however illiberal,
were   not sufficiently detrimental to prevent economic expansion.

While the Mexican economy grew in the colonial period, the
society was remarkably unequal. The population was divided into
legally defined racial categories, and the divisions corresponded to
economic cleavages. One reconstruction shows the Spanish upper
class (10% of the population) getting 61% of the total income,
while the native peasants (60% of the people) received only 17%.
Mexican inequality was greatly in excess of that in the New
England   and Middle Atlantic colonies and was probably similar to
the Caribbean and plantation regions of the US South, although
exact measurement is impossible at present. This much inequality
proved bad for growth after independence.

Independence: USA

The USA declared independence from Britain in 1776, and its
system of government was established, with the Constitution

78


adopted in 1787. The economy took off in the antebellum period
(1790–1860). The population increased by a factor of eight, and
income per head doubled.

One can interpret the antebellum economy as another example of
the staples theory.

Tobacco, rice, and indigo lost momentum, but their place was
taken by the greatest staple of them all – cotton. Demand for the
fibre soared in Britain as the Industrial Revolution unfolded.

Cotton was grown in Georgia but was not a high-profit activity
until Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin in 1793. Cultivation then
spread across the US South. The crop was grown on large slave
plantations, and slave imports expanded until Congress prohibited
them   in 1808. In the next half century, the slave population grew
by natural increase, and the growth was validated economically by
the rapid expansion of the cotton textile industry. In the 1850s,
cotton was highly profitable, and slavery would not have ended
without the Civil War (1861–5).

Staples theorists believe that cotton exports drove the whole US
economy. According to this view, Midwestern agriculture
expanded in order to supply plantations with food – a conclusion
that has been much disputed. Cotton was also responsible for the
industrialization of the northeast since southern plantations and
western farms were the markets for its products.

The industrialization of the USA also depended on four supportive
policies that constituted the ‘standard model’ for economic
development in the 19th century. The first was mass education.

Great strides in this direction had been taken in the colonial period,
and they were extended in the 19th century and were increasingly
guided by economic motives. The other three policies were
originally proposed by Alexander Hamilton in his Report on
Manufactures (1792) and consisted of transportation improvements
to   expand the market, a national bank to stabilize the currency and

79


insure a supply of credit, and a tariff to protect industry. Without
the tariff, the southern and western purchases of manufactures
would not have led to US industrialization since Britain would have
satisfied the demand, as it did in the colonial period.

Henry Clay, a US senator, dubbed Hamilton’s proposals ‘the
American system’, but they were applied by many countries after
they  were popularized by Friedrich List. The constitution itself
was  a first step towards implementation since it abolished state
tariffs and created the legal basis for a national market. The
remaining steps were taken with the construction of the
Cumberland  road linking the Potomac River to the Ohio River in
1811–18  and the Erie Canal connecting the Hudson River to Lake
Erie (1817–25), the chartering of the First and then the Second
Banks of the United States in 1791 and 1816, and a series of tariffs
beginning in 1816.

Before 1816, the USA had only a low tariff, but the Napoleonic
Wars targeted American shipping and led to US protectionist
measures, trade embargoes, and a war with Britain in 1812.

Manufacturing expanded behind these barriers. After
Napoleon’s defeat at Waterloo in 1815, the USA enacted the
Tariff       of 1816 to protect manufacturing, with a duty of 20% on
most goods and 25% on textiles. Rates were raised in 1824 and
1828, but high tariffs were controversial and were lowered again
in 1846.

Protectionism became a characteristically American policy as
Northern interests took charge of the country. The Civil War
increased  the need for federal revenue, and tariffs were raised with
the Morrill Tariff of 1861. Over the next century, tariff rates rose
again and again, culminating in the Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930.
The UK, which had followed free trade since repeal of the Corn
Laws in 1846 and the Navigation Acts three years later, enacted a
tariff in 1932. Most other countries responded to the world
Depression in the same way. It has only been since the Second

80


World War that the USA has sought to unwind the system of
protection, finding that its interests were better served by
penetrating other countries’ markets than by protecting its own.

US cotton manufacturing grew rapidly behind the tariff wall. In
the 1850s, the British industry was the largest in the world,
consuming 290,000 tons of raw cotton per year, but the USA was
number two (111,000 tons) and considerably ahead of France,
which was in third place with 65,000 tons. Alexander Hamilton
and Henry Clay would have been pleased that the impetus
imparted to the economy by cotton exports had produced such
progress.

This conclusion, however, attaches too much importance to staple
exports. First, although cotton (and later wheat) were major
foreign earners, total exports were only 5–7% of GDP in 1800–60.
This was far less than the 30% realized in Pennsylvania and
coastal South Carolina, to say nothing of the 41% reached in
Jamaica. Cotton and wheat exports were not substantial enough
to  drive the antebellum economy. Second, the labour market
performed better than the staples theory predicts. In the 18th
century,  the real wage in Pennsylvania was marginally greater
than  real wages in England, which is what one would expect if the
USA was growing and drawing immigrants from Europe (Figure
15). With American independence and European warfare, the
Atlantic labour market disintegrated, and the USA real wage grew
continuously while British wages stagnated during the Industrial
Revolution. By the 1830s, real wages in the USA were double
those    in Britain. Immigration should have kept wages lower if the
staples model was in play.

The rise in GDP and wages indicates that the USA had developed
the capacity to generate rising productivity through its own
efforts. A major question in staples theory is how and when an
economy develops beyond dependence on its staple. Evidently, the
USA made the transition in the first half of the 19th century.

81


A venerable explanation is Habakkuk’s hypothesis that the
abundance of free land on the frontier generated high real wages
–   why should anyone work for a low wage in New York or
Philadelphia if he could move west and start a farm? – and these,
in   turn, induced businesses to invent labour-saving technology
that pushed up GDP per head and ultimately raised wages even
further. The USA, along with Britain and the Netherlands, was
one  of the handful of economies that consistently pioneered

high-productivity, capital-intensive technology in the last two
centuries, as discussed in Chapter 4.

Indeed, one can see these forces at work in the cotton textile
industry. Its success required the tariff, but the tariff was not
enough. The success of cotton textiles depended on technological
breakthroughs that produced a particularly labour-saving
technology.   The high cost of labour led American firms to
experiment  with machines beginning in the 1770s, but
commercial  success required workers and managers experienced
in    the technology. In 1793, the first commercially successful mill
was built and managed by Samuel Slater, who had worked in an
English factory. The next breakthrough was the construction of an
integrated spinning and power weaving mill by the Boston
Manufacturing Company in Waltham, Massachusetts, in 1813.

Francis Cabot Lowell founded the firm after visiting Britain and
seeing power looms, which he sketched from memory. Production
models were made by Lowell’s engineer, Paul Moody. One of the
most remarkable features of the Lowell–Moody system was the
degree to which British technology was redesigned to make it
suitable to American conditions. By the 1820s, the real wage in
America was higher than in Britain, and, as a result, the
Americans  took up the power loom more rapidly than the British.
America was taking the world lead in industrial technology.

American advances were not confined to cotton textiles. In 1782,
Oliver Evans built the first automatic flour mill. Before the 19th
century, the trigger mechanisms of pistols and rifles were bespoke,

82


and the gunsmith had to fit each component to its companion in
order for the mechanism to work smoothly. The Frenchman
Honoré Blanc and the American Eli Whitney were the first to
conceive and experiment with interchangeable parts, but they
could   not be made on a mass scale until the milling machine was
invented around 1816. American government arsenals in
Springfield  and Harper’s Ferry in the 1820s fabricated
interchangeable  parts for muskets. American firearms exhibited in
the   Crystal Palace Exhibition of 1851 so impressed the British that
they sent a delegation to study the ‘American system’.

Interchangeability spread to private arms producers like Colt,
then to watch manufacturers in the mid-19th century, and, next,
to bicycles, sewing machines, farm machinery, and, finally,
automobiles, where they were a building block of Ford’s assembly-
line system. The success of the American economy depended on
the application of inventive engineering across the full spectrum
of industries. The incentive to mechanize was provided by the
high cost of labour. The successful response required a large pool
of potential inventors. The interplay between challenge and
response made the USA the world’s productivity leader by the
First World War.

Independence: Latin America

The Spanish Empire lasted 300 years as an alliance between the
monarchy and the white colonial elites. Spain’s Bourbon kings
tried to create a modern fiscal-military state in the 18th century,
but their demands for revenue were resisted in the colonies.

Resistance to Madrid, however, was always tempered by the racial
and economic divisions in colonial society. The wide-ranging
attacks on whites and their property in the Túpac Amaru revolt in
Peru in 1780 was only one of many unpleasant reminders of the
dangers at the base of the social pyramid. Spanish America had
de  facto independence thrust upon it by Napeoleon’s invasion of
Spain in 1808. Re-establishment of the empire proved impossible.
In Mexico, for instance, Miguel Hidalgo led a revolt of natives in

83


1810 against the ruling peninsulares (Spanish-born whites).
While this appealed to creoles (Mexican-born whites) at the
outset, native violence against whites in general prevented a
united movement against Spain, and the revolt was put down.
Independence was achieved in 1821 by a creole coup anxious to
preserve    its privileges, which it saw threatened by rising liberalism
in Spain.

Independence brought decades of economic stagnation rooted in
the dilemmas of the colonial society. Greater international
competition was already undermining Mexico’s manufacturing
sector    in the late 18th century. The result was de-industrialization,
as  in India. Alexander von Humboldt explained how ‘The town of
Puebla was formerly celebrated for its fine manufactories of delf
ware (loza) and hats.’ At the ‘commencement of the eighteenth
century’, exports from ‘these two branches of industry enlivened
the commerce between Acapulco and Peru’. European imports
destroyed this trade, however.

At present there is little or no communication between Puebla
and Lima, and the delf manufactories have fallen so much off, on
account of the low price of the stone ware and porcelain of Europe
imported at Vera Cruz, that of 46 manufactories which were still
existing in 1793, there were in 1802 only sixteen remaining of delf
ware, and two of glass.

Real wages slumped from twice subsistence in 1780 to bare-bones
subsistence in the 1830s.

The textile industries were also hurt by British imports. Most
Mexican cloth was wool, and cottons were imported from
Catalonia.  When Britain’s blockades of Spain in the 1790s cut off
imports, cotton cloth production took off in Puebla. The boom was
brief, for Spanish imports resumed after 1804, and the country was
engulfed with cheap British cloth after independence. The Mexican
cotton industry foundered. The response was a version of Henry

84


Clay’s American system and List’s proposals for Germany. Lucas
Alamán, the Minister of Interior and Foreign Affairs, introduced a
tariff on cotton textile imports and channelled some of the
proceeds  to the Banco de Avío, which financed equipment
purchases   for new factories. A national market, however, was not
created, for state tariffs remained and little was done to improve
transportation. Mass education was also ignored.

The results were likewise mixed. On the one hand, about 35
cotton spinning mills were established between 1835 and 1843.
Real wages also recovered after 1840. On the other hand, there
was no stimulation to an engineering industry since the machines
were imported, as were the engineers who installed them and
supervised their operation. Moreover, these mills led nowhere.

The industry stagnated in the middle of the 19th century, and
developments in other industries were meagre. This was no
general advance as in the USA.

The next burst of economic growth was during the Porfiriato
period under the dictatorship of Porfirio Diaz between 1877 and
1911. He applied the 19th-century development strategy more
vigorously than Alamán. A national market was created through
an extensive programme of railway building and the abolition of
taxes for goods crossing state boundaries. Tariffs were used to
support Mexican industries. A policy innovation was to rely on
foreign investment, rather than national investment banks, for
capital. Foreign investment also became the medium for
introducing advanced technology.

Economic development in the Porfiriato was a mixed success. On
the one hand, some impressive industrial growth was achieved.
GDP per capita rose from $674 in 1870 to $1,707 in 1911. On the
other, there was little local contribution to technological progress
since foreign engineers simply installed foreign-designed factories,
and that absence ultimately meant that development did not
spread beyond the state-promoted industries. Moreover, the gains

85


from growth were not distributed widely. Real wages trended
downward under Diaz’s rule. Revolution broke out in 1911.

Education and invention

Why did the American economy grow so much more rapidly than
the Mexican? An influential interpretation attributes US success
to the ‘high quality’ of its institutions and Mexico’s performance to
the ‘low quality’ of its. But which institutions? The US advantages
ran from an English system of property rights and courts,
legislative (and judicial) checks on the executive, egalitarianism
(but  not in the South), democracy, and laissez-faire policies

(but not the tariffs). Mexican disadvantages included the natives’
communal ownership of land, extreme social and racial inequality,
and   a political system that perpetuated the worst features of the
colonial heritage – a set of courts with conflicting jurisdictions, a
state that excessively regulated business, and an inefficient tax
system (although one might question their importance in view of
the growth achieved in the colonial period).

Economic policies had greater impact on the economy than these
institutions. The USA pioneered the standard 19th-century
development strategy at the beginning of the century. A national
market   was created by the Constitution, which abolished state
tariffs, and by transportation improvements that were extended as
new technologies (steam boats, railways) were invented, a
protective tariff was erected in 1816, a national banking system
was  created to stabilize the currency, and mass education began in
the colonial period. Mexico implemented these policies gradually
– tariffs and banks in the 1830s, a national market only after 1880,
and mass education late in the 20th century. The differences in
educational policy go a long way to explaining the different
development trajectories.

The different technological trajectories reflect differences in the
supply and demand of technology. As early as 1800, real wages in

86


the USA were considerably greater than English wages. This
premium created a demand for labour-saving machinery. As
invention occurred and productivity rose, wages increased further,
and  the process became self-reinforcing. In Mexico, on the other
hand, wages were much lower, so this incentive was lacking.

The supply of technology was also much greater in the USA than
in Mexico. This was not a question of religious differences or of
medieval or irrational features of Hispanic culture. We have this
on  the authority of the great geographer and pillar of German
science, Alexander von Humboldt, who lived in Mexico during
1803. He was impressed by Mexican science.

No city of the new continent, without even excepting those of
the United States, can display such great and solid scientific
establishments as the capital of Mexico.

He instanced its university, school of mines, art institutes,
botanical garden, and savants. The scientific culture was spread to
the populace through public lectures, and scientific learning
extended far into the provinces.

A European traveller cannot undoubtedly but be surprised to meet
in the interior of the country, on the very borders of California, with
young Mexicans who reason on the decomposition of water in the
process of amalgamation with free air.

It was not the absence of the Enlightenment that held Mexico
back, but a general shortage of skills in the work force. Literacy is
an indicator. In the USA, over 70% of adult white males were
literate at the end of the 18th century, and close to 100% by 1850.
The black slaves (14% of the population), on the other hand, were
almost entirely illiterate, so overall literacy for men was about
86%.  In Mexico, the white population was also highly literate, and
the rest were not: ‘the cast of whites is the only one in which we
find . . . anything like intellectual cultivation’. In Mexico, whites

87


comprised only 20% of the population, so the overall literacy rate
was of that order.

The technological significance of this difference is clear in the
biographies of inventors in the USA and Britain. Virtually all
inventors  were literate. Illiterate people would have found it
difficult    to invent since they would have had no access to technical
literature. In addition, inventors operated businesses in which
they corresponded, entered contracts, obtained patents, and
negotiated with clients. To be part of that world, one had to be
able     to read and write. In the USA, most of the white males were
potential members. In Mexico, about 80% of the population was
excluded. The scope for a creative engineering response was
correspondingly reduced.

The immediate reason for the difference between the two
countries is obvious: the USA had more schools than Mexico. New
England had achieved close to complete literacy for its male
population  in the colonial period, with state-financed schools and
compulsory attendance. Horace Mann led the renewal of
Massachusetts education, and in 1852 a system modelled on
Prussia’s     was adopted. The ‘common school movement’ spread to
other northern states where it met the needs of industry. Mass
education became as American as high tariffs. In 1862, the
Vermont congressman Justin Smith Morrill, who had sponsored
the protective tariff bill the previous year, introduced a bill to
grant federal land to states to establish universities. Over 70

so-called ‘land grant colleges’ were created. Between 1910 and
1940, the ‘high school movement’ saw the creation of state
secondary schools across the country. Since the Second World
War, there has been further expansion of high schools and
universities.

There was no comparable expansion in education in Mexico
before the 20th century. The Revolution led to more schooling,
but in 1946 over half of the adults were still illiterate. There has

been a great extension of education at all levels in the past half
century. For Mexico, however, it came two centuries too late.

Why did the USA and Mexico follow different trajectories? The
demand for literacy and numeracy was greater in the colonial
USA  than in Mexico because the North American colonies were
staple economies and the settlers expected to achieve a European
standard of living by selling a large proportion of their produce to
buy English consumer goods. This commercial activity was
facilitated by the ability to read and write. In Mexico, in contrast,
the native population was much less commercially active and so
found these skills to be less useful.

Governments were also keener to build schools in the USA than in
Latin America. The egalitarian economies of New England and
the Middle Atlantic states underpinned democratic polities that
provided public services like education that were widely
demanded. Mexico, in contrast, was run by a white elite whose
interests were not served by schooling the masses. So they
remained uneducated. Inequality was high, and governments also
represented narrow elites in the Andes and in the colonies built on
slave labour such as the Caribbean and Brazil, with the same
result  – little schooling across Latin America.

The USA provides a revealing comparison, for its most prosperous
region in the colonial period was also built on slave labour. Why
did  it not suffer the fate of Jamaica or Brazil? After the abolition
of slavery and the end of reconstruction, the states of the South
were also highly unequal and governed by an elite that had little
interest in educating the African American population. Access to
schooling and its quality were low until the end of segregation in
the 1960s. This was a major reason why the South became the
poorest region of the country. The major difference between the
USA and Latin America was the share of the population that was
socially excluded. In the USA, African Americans made up

one-seventh of the total, while the natives and blacks in Latin

89


American comprised two-thirds of the total. Had the USA treated
70% of its population as it treated its African Americans, the
result would not simply have been injustice on an expanded scale.
Rather, it would have been national failure, for the USA could
never have become an economic powerhouse with such limited
provision of education.

Chapter 7

Africa

African poverty is not new. Sub-Saharan Africa was the poorest
region of the world in 1500, and it remains so – despite the
increase  in income per head that has occurred. The aim of this
chapter  is to identify the structures and the contingent events that
have kept Africa poor for so long.

The ‘short list’ of candidates is long. Colonial ideology persists in
some Western circles, where the poverty of Africans is attributed
to their imagined laziness or lack of intelligence. Subtler versions
include the view that Africans are bound by tradition or non-
commercial values. None of these claims, however, stands up to
historical examination.

Institutional explanations for African poverty are also favourites.
The slave trade is popular, and, indeed, the poorest countries in
Africa today are the ones that exported the most slaves. However,
even the countries that resisted the slavers vigorously are still
very poor by today’s standards, so something else was going on.
Colonialism is another favourite explanation since, in many
places,     its aim was to transfer wealth from Africans to Europeans.
While some development occurred under colonial rule, European
administration did not kick-start modern economic growth.

Dependency theorists say the reason was too much globalization,
for they maintain that Africa’s concentration on exporting

91


primary products has worked to the continent’s disadvantage in
the long run. Finally, many recent commentators have
emphasized the corruption, interventionism, and
authoritarianism    of African governments. If failed states were
only    replaced by Western-run administrations, the economies
would take off – but only, of course, if the foreigners got it right
the second time around.

To understand why Africa is poor today, we must understand why
it was poor in 1500. The answer turns on geography, demography,
and the origin of agriculture. The social and economic structure of
1500 then determined how the continent responded to
globalization and imperialism, and those responses have kept it
poor   since.

Africa and the great divergence debate

Sub-Saharan Africa was poor in 1500 because it was not an
advanced agrarian civilization. There were only a few – Western
Europe, the Middle East, Persia, parts of India, China, and Japan.
They were the countries that were in a position to have an
industrial revolution. The rest of the world, including Africa, was
not,  and that is why Africa is left out of the great divergence
debate.

The agrarian civilizations had many advantages that set them
apart from Africa – productive agriculture, diversified
manufacturing, and the institutional and cultural resources
necessary    for modern economic growth. These included private
property in land and landless labourers as well as the cultural
correlates needed to organize property and commerce – writing,
land surveying, geometry, arithmetic, standardized weights and
measures, coins, and a legal system based on written documents
and officials who could manage those texts. These cultural
elements were necessary for the advancement of trade, for the
development of learning, mathematics, and science, and for the

92


invention and diffusion of modern technology. Sub-Saharan Africa
lacked these preconditions, as did much of Southeast Asia,
Australia, New Zealand, northern Eurasia, Polynesia, and the
lightly populated parts of the Americas.

Africa’s historical trajectory was influenced by the nature of early
agriculture and its relationship to demography. Around 3000
BCE,   sheep and cattle were introduced from the Middle East to
graze on the Sahara (which was wetter than today), and wheat and
barley were grown in the Nile Valley and on the Ethiopian plateau.
Later, Ethiopians expanded the plant repertoire by domesticating
teff, finger millet, sesame, mustard, ensete, and coffee. Mixed
husbandry evolved in which the cropped fields were tilled with

ox-drawn ploughs and manured by sheep and cattle. There were
also investments in terracing and irrigation. Ethiopia was the only
part of sub-Saharan Africa to develop an advanced agrarian
civilization. Around 2000–1500 BCE, millet and sorghum were
domesticated in the vicinity of Lake Chad. The cultivators also
kept    sheep, but mixed farming along Ethiopian lines was not
practised. Even today, sorghum and millet are cultivated in
shifting systems with hoes rather than oxen and ploughs. Finally,
yams and palm oil formed the basis of agriculture in the
rainforest. Yams were domesticated in Nigeria, where they thrive
today. Livestock husbandry was absent since horses, cattle, and
sheep died of the sleeping sickness carried by the tsetse fly native
to the rainforest.

The farming system of West Africa was responsive to new
opportunities as they arose. Between the 1st and 8th centuries CE,
new   crops were introduced from Asia including bananas,
plantains, Asian yams, coco yams (taro), and beans. The repertoire
was significantly broadened again in the 16th century with the
introduction of maize, manioc (cassava), groundnuts, and tobacco
from   the Americas. These quickly became ‘traditional’ crops,
showing the vacuousness of ‘unchanging tradition’ as an
explanation   of African poverty.

93


The domestication of crops resulted in permanent farming
villages and a rise in the birth rate in Africa as it did everywhere in
the world. In the Ethiopian highlands, where tropical diseases
were absent, the population grew rapidly. As land became scarce,
the state and the aristocracy could support themselves by leasing
or taxing it. Communal property was privatized, and landless
labourers emerged as people who lost their right to farm wherever
they wanted. The Kingdom of D’mt in northern Ethiopia and
Eritrea was founded in the 8th century BCE. Its agriculture was
based on the plough and irrigation, iron was known, and its
language was written. D’mt was succeeded by the grander
Kingdom    of Aksum.

The growth in population in West Africa was restrained because
tropical diseases kept mortality high. The most lethal form of
malaria and its associated mosquito (Plasmodium falciparum
and Anopheles gambiae) appeared about the same time that
yam cultivators were first clearing the rainforest. These
clearings probably contributed to the evolution of the disease.

Other tropical diseases such as sleeping sickness also played
a role.

West Africa remained a land-abundant farming region, and
shifting cultivation was the appropriate response to that
circumstance. An example is the group known as the Yakö. They
lived    in the rainforest of eastern Nigeria and subsisted on yams.
In the 1930s, the Yakö village of Umor claimed 40 square miles
suitable for cultivation. Only about 3 square miles were planted
each year, however. After harvesting, the land was allowed to
revert to bush for six years and new land was cleared for
planting. Allowing for fallowing, only 21 of the 40 square miles
of farmable land were in use. The remainder was available for
children or anyone needing land. Consequently, there was no
class   of landless labourers in the village, nor was there a demand
for land to buy or rent since anyone could clear a plot without
depriving anyone else.

Cultivating yams and harvesting oil and wine from palms did not
require much work and provided enough food for subsistence.

Table 5, Panel A, shows a reconstruction of the food production of
a typical Yakö family in Umor. The family consisted of a man, two
wives, and four or five children. Each year, they planted 1.4 acres
with yams and some coco yams, with cow peas, pumpkins, okra,
and other vegetables planted among them. The diet was
overwhelmingly vegetable – a small amount of bush meat was
hunted     and a bit of purchased meat flavoured the yams. In
addition,  the family consumed palm oil and half a gallon of palm
wine  per day. The energy intake amounted to 1,941 calories per
adult-male equivalent per day. These people were at bare-bones
subsistence. Cultivating their garden and harvesting the palms
took     the three adults a total of 400 days per year. The consumption
pattern of Africans was probably similar before the arrival of the
Europeans.

The low population density and high transportation costs limited
the possibilities for specialized manufacturers supporting large
markets. There was an iron industry, which was established in
West Africa around 1200 BCE, but total production was low.

Cotton was grown in the savannah and woven into cloth on hand
looms. The industry was centred around Kano, but, as with iron,
production was at a low level. Instead of buying manufactures,
most   people made their own simple implements and bark clothing.
Consequently, the range of available consumer goods was limited.
People   grew enough food to meet their own needs but nothing
more, since there was nothing to buy with the surplus. Cultivation
took only part of the year, and for the rest they enjoyed leisure.

Two styles of politics were attractive with this production system.
The first was the band or tribe – a confederation of the cultivators
in an area. It could organize the allocation of land and resolve
disputes about its use, and the men constituted a militia that
defended the territory from other groups. Leaders were styled
‘chiefs’  and held their posts through persuasion. This political
system was relatively egalitarian.

96


Shifting cultivation included one feature that gave rise to
hierarchical social organization, and that feature was the large
amount   of leisure enjoyed by cultivators. If they were
compelled    to work more, they would grow food beyond their
subsistence requirements, and that surplus could support
complete idleness for some or (at the political level) a military
establishment. The attractions of idleness and power made
slavery compelling. The difficulty was that an empty landscape
presented slaves with opportunities to run away and support
themselves. The French Congo furnishes 20th-century
examples:  villagers fled into the bush and lived for years as
foragers    to avoid military conscription or forced labour on
rubber plantations. African chiefs eliminated this option by
slave-raiding in other regions, so captives did not know the
local   language or how to survive in the local ecology. Of course,
their children knew these things, so slavery often lasted only
one generation, and the children of slaves were admitted as
members of the tribe. Slavery was common in Africa before the
Europeans arrived and was the basis of many states.

While Africa had states, they were different from states in
advanced agricultural economies. Agrarian states could support
themselves through taxing land or renting out state property.

That was not possible in Africa since land was so abundant as
to be worthless. As a result, African states lacked the legal and
cultural institutions that advanced agricultural societies used
to organize private property such as surveying, arithmetic,
geometry, and writing. The exceptions that prove the rule were
the  West African empires of the Savannah like Ghana, Mali,
and Songhai. Farmland was communally owned, and slavery
was widespread. State revenue, however, came mainly from
taxing trans-Saharan trade and gold production (not
agriculture). Islam was adopted in these empires, and
contributed  writing and property law to solve their
administrative problems.

97


The slave trade

The arrival of Europeans led to profound changes in societies
practising shifting cultivation, for the Europeans introduced a far
broader range of goods than the natives possessed. It never took
long  for aboriginal Americans, Polynesians, or Africans to realize
that cotton made better clothing than bark or that guns were more
deadly than spears. In 1895, Mary Kingsley trekked through
Gabon  and reported that most Africans,

young and old, men and women, regard trade as the great affair
of life, take to it as soon as they can toddle, and don’t even leave it
off at death, according to their own accounts of the way the spirits

of distinguished traders will dabble and interfere in market matters.

Africa was not unique in this regard. Before the French arrived,
the Huron of Canada cooked in a hollowed-out stump filled with
water brought to the boil with hot stones. The natives were so
impressed by the kettles of the French fur traders that they
imagined  that the man who made the biggest pots must be the
King   of France. To buy the European kettles, axes, and cloth, the
natives needed something to sell in return, and when they found
their staple, they increased their working year to produce it for
export. In North America, the product was fur. In c.1680, a
Micmac joked with a French Franciscan:

In truth, my brother, the Beaver does everything to perfection. He
makes for us kettles, axes, swords, knives, and gives us drink and
food without the trouble of cultivating the ground.

West Africa exported gold to the Mediterranean and Arab worlds, but
a far more important export emerged in the 16th century – slaves. The
sugar economy of the Americas generated a great demand for labour
that could be satisfied most cheaply by buying workers. In 1526,
Alfonso  I, the African King of Kongo who sought to convert his people
to Christianity, complained to the Portuguese King João III that ‘many

98


of our subjects eagerly lust after Portuguese merchandise that your
subjects have brought to our domains. To satisfy this inordinate
appetite,  they seize many of our free black subjects . . . [and] sell them’
to  slave traders on the coast. In the 17th century, kingdoms like
Dahomey and the Ashanti, which had long been based on slavery,
responded  to the external demand for slaves with warfare and raiding.
The captives were marched to the coast where they were sold to
European ships. The African kings used the proceeds to buy firearms
(which increased their power and helped their slave-raiding), textiles,
and alcohol. Between 1500 and 1850, 10 to 12 million slaves were
transported to the New World. Millions more were taken across the
Sahara,   or over the Red Sea and Indian Ocean for sale in Asia.

Legitimate commerce

In the 18th century, enlightened and religious opinion turned
against slavery, and the trade was abolished in the British Empire in
1807. Slaves were replaced with new exports – the so-called
‘legitimate commerce’. The first new product was palm oil, which
was     in demand as a lubricant for machinery and railway equipment
as well as to make soap and candles. In 1842, Francis Swanzy, an
English magistrate on the Gold Coast, told a British parliamentary
committee how the new export trades increased the work effort of
Africans  by providing them with the opportunity to purchase
consumer goods:

The wants of the people are daily increasing. Go into the native’s
house and you will find articles of European furniture; in his house
European implements of agriculture; they wear more clothes; in fact,
their situation is greatly improving, their wants increasing, and they
cannot supply those wants basking idly in the sun; they must work.

Cotton cloth amounted to over half of Britain’s exports to West
Africa, and metals and metal products including firearms
accounted for much of the rest. Asked how they could afford
British products, Swanzy replied:

99


They go into the bush and dig for gold; a great many make palm-oil.
There was 20 years ago, scarcely any exported; now there is a great
deal exported; ground nuts also are exported.

The oil was transported to the coast along the same commercial
networks that had previously moved slaves. Nigeria was the largest
exporter, but production spread throughout West Africa. The
commercial possibilities were enlarged further in the middle of the
19th century, when it was discovered that the kernel of the palm fruit
yielded an oil well suited to margarine. Palm oil could be raised on
plantations, but it remained the domain of individuals harvesting
wild   stands. In Nigeria in the early 20th century, for instance, 2.4
million hectares of wild groves were harvested, as opposed to 72,000
hectares in estate plantations and 97,000 hectares planted by
smallholders. The typical Yakö family discussed previously worked
an     extra 155 days per year to produce 12 four-gallon tins (each
weighing 36 pounds) of palm oil, over 700 pounds of palm kernels,
and   93 half-gallon bottles of palm wine sold locally. Their biggest
purchases were cloth and clothing, but they also bought cutlery,
utensils, cosmetics, ornaments (all imported), and meat.

Since the reason Africans produced palm oil was to buy European
goods, their incentive depended on how much cloth they could get
for each can of oil that they sold. Figure 17 shows the price of palm
oil relative to cotton cloth at West African ports from 1817 to the
present. In the case of palm oil, there was a sharp rise in the price of
oil relative to cloth from 1817 to the middle of the 19th century.

Africans could get more and more cloth for their oil over this period,
and that induced them to increase production. British imports rose
from a few tons per year in 1800 to 25,000 in the middle of the 19th
century to almost 100,000 tons around the First World War.

Palm products were not the only West African exports. Cocoa was
another great success. The bean was indigenous to the Americas
and introduced into Africa in the 19th century. In Britain, the price
of cocoa doubled with respect to the price of cotton cloth between

the 1840s and the 1880s (Figure 18), and that increase prompted
Africans (not Europeans!) to experiment with its production,
which  began on a large scale in Ghana in the 1890s. Since cocoa
was  not indigenous, forest had to be cleared and trees planted. This
posed a challenge to communal property systems, which let any
tribal member occupy empty land. The Africans modified their
system of property to facilitate cocoa growing. One solution was to
separate ownership of the trees from ownership of the land, so that
the planter of the tree secured a return on his investment whoever
was growing yams or manioc in the surrounding fields.

A more radical solution was effected by the Krobo. Groups of
Krobo collectively purchased land from other tribes and then
divided  it amongst themselves in individual tenure. Once they had
developed their plots, they repeated the process, moving westward
across Ghana eventually into the Côte d’Ivoire. As a result, many
Krobo own plots scattered across these countries. Some plots they
farm, and some they lease out. Migration and homesteading
required a high level of investment that was financed with savings
from cocoa trees already in production. The Krobo look like
Weber’s Protestant ethic in operation.

Colonialism

European colonialism began with the Portuguese, who established
settlements in what are now Guinea-Bissau, Angola, and
Mozambique   in the 15th and 16th centuries. The other leading
European powers established forts on the coast of West Africa to
facilitate slave trading, and the Dutch established their settlement
on   the Cape of Good Hope in 1652. European colonialism became
more earnest in the 19th century, but it was not until the end of the
century that the continent was divided among the imperial powers.

Colonies were acquired for economic as well as strategic reasons.
The hope was that they would supply tropical products to the
imperial power and be a market for its manufactures, as well as

102


providing places for its citizens to settle and profitable
investments for its bourgeoisie. In addition, empires were
regarded     as civilizing missions that would spread Christianity and
raise native culture to the standard of Europe. These aims were
expected to be accomplished at no cost to the imperial power,
since colonial governments were supposed to finance their
expenditures with their own revenues.

Colonialism proved even more detrimental to economic
development in Africa than in other parts of the world. African
colonialism created remarkably bad institutions. The early African
colonies, like their predecessors in North America, were organized
through ‘direct rule’, in which the colonial government applied
metropolitan law throughout its territory to settlers and natives,
although  the latter were often non-enfranchised. By the late 19th
century, however, direct rule was replaced by ‘indirect rule’. The
aim  was to make foreign occupation palatable to the indigenous
population by recognizing every ethnic distinction and by

offering power and wealth to compliant leaders in exchange for
supporting the foreigners. In this system, the colonial state applied
metropolitan law to settlers and in cities. Control of the natives in
the countryside was devolved to ‘chiefs’ who applied the ‘customs’
of their ‘tribe’. The terms are in quotes to emphasize that they were
legal concepts of the colonial state with little necessary connection
to the pre-colonial reality. All African polities, from kingdoms like
the Ashanti to the least structured band, were conceived as
equivalent entities with uniform customs, despite the fact that the
complex polities included conquered peoples with disparate
customs. Chiefs were created in places like northern Ghana and
eastern Nigeria where they had never ruled before. Many of the
polities had been fluid, and the right of people to leave oppressive
regimes was a check on tyrannical rulers. This right was removed
when people were assigned to tribes they could no longer leave.

Custom was redefined to suit colonial purposes. ‘Barbaric’ customs
like slavery were eliminated (although it continued in practice),
while useful customs like a chief ’s right to demand unpaid labour

103


were retained. In that way, forced labour became a normal feature
of colonial life. Communal landownership usually became a
custom, so people could acquire farm land only by being members
of   a tribe – and at the discretion of the chief, to whom they were
subservient. Traditional processes were used where possible to
ennoble  chiefs, but, in the final analysis, they were appointed by
the occupying power. Chiefs were given more authority than rulers
had before colonialism. The new-style chiefs became the foremen
of empire, levying taxes, compelling labour, and using their powers
to amass personal fortunes. Colonialism created a system of

rent-seeking petty despots to rule the countryside.

The policies pursued by African colonies were at least as
detrimental to growth as those followed in India and elsewhere.
Colonial governments adopted only one element of the standard
19th-century development model – transportation improvements.
By   the First World War, 35,000 kilometres of railway were opened
in sub-Saharan Africa. These were financed by private investment
(often with public guarantees) and were intended to facilitate
exporting primary products by linking the interior to ports. Tariffs
were not used to promote manufacture but were kept at low levels
for revenue purposes only. The colonial economies were, therefore,
fully integrated into the world market. As ocean freight rates
declined and overland transport costs fell, the prices of European
manufactures declined in Africa and the prices of primary
products  increased. The economies reacted accordingly. The
production and export of products like palm oil and ground nuts
shot   up; conversely, the production of cotton textiles in Kano
declined. Globalization meant that the economy of Africa became
specialized in the production of primary products.

Colonial governments did not attempt to educate the African
population. The task was left to Christian missions, Muslim
madrasahs, and other independent initiatives. Some progress was
made, particularly among groups like the Krobo, whose
commercial activities gave them an incentive to acquire literacy

104


and whose success gave them the income to purchase schooling.
Literacy rates remained very low until after independence.

Colonial governments also made no effort to establish local banks
to finance investment. Some colonies did promote foreign
investment, but it was at the expense of Africans, for the foreigners
were granted ownership of the continent’s resources. There were
considerable differences between colonies in this regard.

At one extreme were the British colonies in West Africa. They
were the birthplace of indirect rule, and exemplified it most
perfectly. Most of the country was under the control of the chiefs.
The acquisition of land by Europeans was discouraged: William
Lever, for instance, was denied large land concessions to establish
oil palm plantations in Nigeria in 1907.

The German, Belgian, and French colonies in West Africa adopted
land and labour policies that were less favourable to native
interests. Land was expropriated by colonial governments and
given   to European investors for plantation and mining
development. The Belgians permitted Unilever to establish oil
palm plantations in the Congo, for instance. Africans were
conscripted to work on plantations and build railways.

At the opposite pole from the British West African colonies were
the settler colonies. South Africa is the most extreme example, but
the history of land expropriation was similar in Zimbabwe and the
Kenyan highlands.

The Cape Town colony had about 25,000 Dutch, German, and
Huguenot settlers when it was taken over by the British in 1806.
The European population grew to 100,000 in 1850 and leapt to
one million in 1900 following the discovery of diamonds in 1866
and gold in 1886. The African population probably rose from 1.5
million to 3.5 million between 1800 and 1900. After 1835, the
Boers advanced out of the Cape colony into the Transvaal, seizing
vast quantities of land from the Africans. The Boers established the

105


Orange Free State and the South African Republic, which were
incorporated into South Africa after they were conquered by the
British    in the war of 1899–1902. The British were no more
sympathetic to African land rights than were the Boers. The
culmination   of the land seizures was the Natives’ Land Act of 1913,
which made it illegal for the Africans to buy or lease land outside of
the native reserves. These amounted to 7% of the land of South
Africa, even though Africans made up two-thirds of the population.

Parallel but less extreme distributions obtained in other settler
colonies. In Zimbabwe, for instance, when the Fast Track Land
Reform Programme started in 2000, 4,500 white farmers owned

11.2 million hectares of the country’s best land, while one million
African families lived on 16.4 million hectares of poorer-quality
communal land. Under these circumstances, the law of real
property   is a system that protects privilege rather than a system
that encourages everyone to advance their interests by making
mutually advantageous trades.

Dispossessing the natives from the land was a policy to secure
their labour as well as to acquire their land. The Reverend J. E.
Casalis observed in the 1860s that the aim of land seizures was:

to force the natives . . . to live within such narrow limits that it
becomes impossible to subsist on the produce of agriculture and
livestock and to be compelled to offer their services to the farmers
in  the capacity of domestic servants and labourers.

This objective was extended by the labour-control systems of
apartheid, which treated Africans as though they resided in the
reserves and were merely guest workers in the country at large.

Contemporary poverty in historical perspective

Early in the 19th century, West Africa embarked on a trajectory that
had much in common with the colonies of North America – the

106


economy was export-oriented, the Africans pushed back the
rainforest in response to high prices in global markets, and income
was ploughed back into businesses. All this enterprise and progress,
however, failed to spark off modern economic growth. Why not?

There are immediate explanations and underlying causes. The
immediate explanation is contained in Figures 17 and 18. They show
that   the real prices of palm oil and cocoa have trended downwards
since the early 20th century. Both prices fell during the First World
War and reached extremely low values during the 1930s and the
Second World War. The price of palm oil (relative to cloth) never
recovered its pre-First World War value, and today is lower than it
was    in the 1930s. Cocoa-producing countries have fared better – but
not cocoa growers. World market prices trended erratically upwards
after the Second World War and hit peaks higher than those of the

1890s. In the principal cocoa exporters like Ghana, the increases in
income accrued to the state rather than the farmers, however,
because  the growers were forced to sell their cocoa to a state-owned
marketing board that resold the product internationally. Ostensibly,
the marketing board protected the growers from fluctuations in the
world market by paying steady prices, but in reality the boards acted
like Soviet procurement agencies and creamed off the rising surplus
from international sales. By keeping prices low, the marketing
boards reduced the incentive to expand production, as well as
keeping  the rural population poor.

The price history translates directly into the real income of the
farmers. Figure 19 shows the combined real earnings per day of a
hypothetical Yakö family harvesting both palm oil and kernels.
The    figure is constructed on the assumption that their efficiency
did not change over the period – the actual state of affairs. The
earnings from palm oil followed the same rollercoaster as its price.
Since 1980, the real incomes of palm producers have been as low

20. Earnings per day from cocoa

108


as they ever were in the 1930s. Cocoa producers have seen a
similar long-run drop, but they missed the rising incomes of the
1960s and 1970s since the cocoa marketing board did not pass the
high world market prices on to the growers (Figure 20).

Today, cocoa producers earn about 10 pence per day in 1913 purchasing
power. This was the wage of a labourer in Accra at that time. Palm oil
producers earn half as much. The situation is the same with all of
Africa’s agricultural exports. Since agriculture employs about 60% of
the population, earnings in that sector determine earnings throughout
the economy. The reason that Africans are poor is because the
continent’s agriculture generates a First World War standard of living.

There are two reasons why African agriculture does not do better.
The first is the fall in the price of farm exports. There are three
reasons for this. One is the invention and cheapening of substitute
products. The advent of the petroleum industry in the second half
of   the 19th century resulted in better and less expensive lubricants
than palm oil. Paraffin, another petroleum product, ousted the
palm oil derivative stearine from candle-making, and, of course,
candles themselves were superseded by kerosene lamps and then
by electric lights. The second is competition with Asian producers.
Oil palms were cultivated in large plantations in Sumatra and
Malaya in the early 20th century, and the plants grew better than
in  West Africa. Since the Second World War, Malaysian and
Indonesian exports have dominated world markets and forced
down    the prices received by Africans. The third reason for low
prices  is the expansion of production in Africa itself. This factor is
particularly important for cocoa since most production is still
African,   and there are no good substitutes for cocoa in chocolate
manufacturing. Cultivation of cocoa expanded westward across
Ghana     into the Côte d’Ivoire. The work force was drawn from
impoverished regions across West Africa. Output has increased,
and    prices have fallen. From this perspective, African poverty is a
vicious circle in which low wages keep down export prices, and low
prices keep down wages.

109


The second reason that cocoa and palm oil do not generate higher
incomes is because productivity is low and stagnant. In part, the
story  is biological. The Germans and the Belgians undertook basic
research on the oil palm, but, ironically, the benefits have been
realized  in Southeast Asia to the detriment of Africa. Compared to
other continents, there has been very little research to improve
African crops.

Mechanization is another source of productivity growth. Most of the
labour in producing palm oil is expended in processing the fruit once
it  is picked. The traditional method involves stacking, fermenting,
boiling, pounding, treading, soaking, skimming, and pressing. Sticks
are used for pounding, the feet for treading, and so forth. Great
strides have been made in mechanizing the processing of fruit grown
on plantations, but progress has been lethargic in the village sector.
Simple machines for pressing the fruit and expelling the oil
considerably reduce the need for labour but at the cost of more
capital.   These machines are not profitable on small farms in West
Africa due to the low wage rate. This is an example of the technology
trap discussed in Chapter 4 whereby low wages mean that it is not
profitable to adopt the mechanized technology required to raise
wages.    In any event, there is little point in freeing labour from
processing palm oil since the non-agricultural population already
exceeds  the number of jobs outside of agriculture.

This labour market imbalance reflects developments of the last 50
years. One has been the growth in population, which has
increased five-fold since 1950. A definitive explanation is
impossible in view of the limited African data, but the experience
of other tropical regions suggests that the immediate cause was a
fall in mortality rates, particularly for infants and the elderly. Very
likely, this was due to improvements in public health and the
spread of modern medical practices.

The other development has been the failure of Africa to
industrialize in this period. There are economic explanations for

110


this as well as broader institutional explanations. All of them
make sense in terms of Africa’s geography and history.

There are three economic explanations for the lack of industry.
The first is comparative advantage. North America exported
wheat  to Europe since wheat production is land-intensive and the
USA had abundant land relative to its population. Africa has an
even lower population density than North America, so its
comparative advantage lies in commodities that use its land and
resources intensively. These are the primary products it exports.
In   the USA, the counterpart to land abundance was high wages,
which would have made manufacturing uncompetitive with
imports  in the 19th century had there been no tariffs. The
situation   is different in Africa, however, for wages are low, yet
manufacturing firms still do not find it profitable to locate there.
The   reason is, presumably, that costs would be high since
production would be inefficient. One reason for low productivity
might   be uneducated workers, but education has expanded
rapidly  in recent decades, so any deficit in that area among young
workers has disappeared – without any noticeable benefit.

Another reason for low productivity is the absence of other
complementary firms. In rich countries, production takes place in
urban  networks where firms support each other by providing
specialized products and services. These ‘external economies of scale’
raise productivity and allow firms to pay high wages while remaining
competitive. Africa is caught in a vicious circle – a network of firms
will  never be established since no firm finds it profitable to set up
business in the absence of the network! In the 19th century, Africa
may  have had the beginnings of these networks with its scattered
iron works, the textile industry at Kano, and so forth, but
globalization, supported by colonialism, drove them out of business.

A final economic argument is technological and applies the
analysis of agricultural mechanization to the industrial sector:
wages  in Africa are too low to make it profitable to use the highly

111


capital-intensive technology of modern industry. Africa is caught
in yet one more trap: mechanized industry is the solution to low
wages, but low wages make mechanization unprofitable!

The most popular explanations for African poverty, however, are
institutional rather than economic: one aspect of ‘bad institutions’
is   endemic warfare, which surely is bad for business. Poverty itself is
a cause of warfare since it makes recruiting troops very cheap. Low
wages causing war, which, in turn, restrains the economy, leading to
low wages – another poverty trap. In addition, the actors and issues
in many well-known wars were the creations of colonial indirect
rule. Belgium controlled Rwanda by elaborating the difference
between Tutsi and Hutu into an imaginary racial division. The Tutsi
were conceived as foreign interlopers, who were superior since they
were descendants of the biblical character Ham, while the Hutus
were regarded as indigenous and inferior. The colonial
administration lavished education and opportunities on the Tutsi,
so       that they could rule the Hutu. However, the Hutu majority finally
seized control of the state in the revolution of 1959. When a Tutsi
army invaded the country in 1990 and defeated the predominantly
Hutu Rwandan army, the Tutsi threatened the gains made by Hutus
since 1959, and the stage was set for the genocide.

Another aspect of ‘bad institutions’ is the corruption and
undemocratic character of many states. These deficiencies are also
legacies    of colonial structures of government. Newly independent
African states inherited constitutions that included racial
distinctions  and embedded the tribal and administrative structures
of  indirect rule. The states have been successful in eliminating
racism but much less successful in eliminating tribalism. In most
countries, there are separate systems of administration for urban
and  rural areas. The former have modern systems of law, and the
latter are divided into the ‘tribal’ areas created during the colonial
period and run by chiefs administering colonial customs including
communal landownership. Often, the continuation of colonial
administration is obscured by adopting uniform legal codes that

112


cobble together the modern and the customary rules in the same
document. Much of rural Africa is consequently governed by a
layer   of non-elected corrupt potentates who can extort income and
labour services from the citizenry and extract rents from the
national administration.

The goal of economic development has added another dimension to
the control of the peasantry. The ideology of the 1960s (both Western
and Communist) saw development as a process in which the urban
economy grew at the expense of the rural. The colonial state had used
the system of indirect rule to govern the countryside for the benefit of
the colonial power. The leaders of independent states took their place
and used the same techniques to benefit the city at the expense of the
countryside. Chiefs were induced to use their ‘traditional’ ownership
of  communal land to expropriate it for development projects, threats
of eviction were used to compel peasants to cooperate with
agricultural innovations, and rural residents were coerced to labour on
infrastructure and plantation projects. In addition, the state directly
coerced peasants; in particular, farmers were forced to sell crops to
government marketing boards, so that food could be sold cheaply to
urban workers and export crops could be taxed by paying the peasants
low prices for products that were sold in international markets at high
prices, as we have seen in the case of cocoa. These efforts brought little
industrial development, while reducing agricultural incentives and
increasing corruption and authoritarianism.

Radical and Marxist-Leninist states followed a seemingly different
path but with similar outcomes. These states abolished tribalism as
well as racism: in the words of Samora Machel, the first president of
Mozambique: ‘For the nation to live, the tribe must die.’ One-party
states   were created to suppress divisions and as vanguards of
progress. The practice of colonialism, however, was harder to
change.  Tribal leaders became cadres of the ruling party and carried
on  as before. In the name of development, the reformed states
adopted the dirigisme of colonial administration – forced labour

re-emerged in them as well. Africa cannot easily escape its history.

Chapter 8

The standard model and late
industrialization

By 1850, Europe and North America had pulled ahead of the rest
of the world. How the poor countries could catch up was the new
problem. Colonies could do little, since their options were
restricted   by the imperial power. Independent states, however,
could apply the standard model – railways, tariffs, banks, and
schools – that had worked for the USA and Western Europe. This
strategy, however, proved less and less fruitful as time went by.

Imperial Russia

Russia was for a long time the most backward part of Europe.
Peter the Great (1672–1725) tried to turn it into a modern Western
power. He built the new port of St Petersburg and founded many
factories mainly devoted to the military. There was no catch-up
with  the West, however. The extent of Russia’s backwardness was
made clear by the country’s defeat by England and France in the
Crimean War (1853–6). Modernization was so pressing that Tsar
Alexander II abolished serfdom. Reformers hoped this would

kick-start economic growth by creating free labour and private
property, but there was no quick response.

The post-emancipation government adopted the standard
development model with some modification. First, a national

114


market was created through a vast programme of railway
construction. By 1913, 71,000 kilometres of track were open and
linked Russia to the global economy.

When the peasants marketed their grain in Nikolayev [in 1903],
they asked, ‘What is the price in America according to the latest
telegram?’ And what is still more surprising they know how to
convert cents per bushel into kopecks per pood.

Second, tariffs were used to build up industry. By 1910, Russia
smelted 4 million tons of pig iron per year. It was not in the first
division with the USA, Germany, and the UK, but it was a leader
in  the second. Russia also developed an important engineering
industry. In addition, the state promoted light industry with high
tariffs on cotton textiles and moderate tariffs on raw cotton. As a
result, the cultivation of cotton expanded in what became
Uzbekistan. In the early 20th century, Russian mills processed
almost   as much cotton as Germany’s. Third, the biggest
innovation  in economic policy lay in finance. Private banks were
too  weak to play the role they had in Belgium or Germany.

Instead, Russia relied on foreign capital. Railways were financed
by selling securities abroad, and foreign direct investment became
the principal means of bringing advanced technology to the
country. Plants were built to West European specifications,
however, without any adaptation to Russia’s different economic
circumstances, with the result that production costs were higher
than    in Western Europe. Fourth, education was expanded from
the 1860s onwards. By the First World War, almost half of the
adult population was literate. Even amongst manual workers, the
earnings of the literate were higher than those of the illiterate, so
schooling was attractive to many people.

The standard model (as amended) boosted the share of heavy
industry in Russia from 2% of GDP in 1885 to 8% in 1913, but
agriculture remained the biggest sector (its share slipped from
59%   to 51%). Agricultural output doubled over this period as the

115


world price of wheat rose, and farming accounted for most of the
growth in GDP. Tsarist economic growth was mainly an
agricultural boom, souped up with some tariff-induced
industrialization. Growth would probably have petered out when
the world price of wheat collapsed after the First World War.

Another economic model was needed to catch up to the West.

An indicator of the limited impact of the standard model in Russia
was the state of the labour market. Despite the growth in GDP,
labour demand did not grow enough to fully employ the
population,  so wages remained at subsistence, and the extra
income  created by growth accrued as profits to the owners of
industry and as rent to the owners of land. These became the

flash-points of social conflict. Unequal development led to a revolt
in 1905 and, more explosively, in 1917. The failure of the standard
model to transform Russia led to its own undoing.

Japan

Japan is a particularly interesting case, for it was the first Asian
country to catch up with the West. Japanese history is divided into
four periods: Tokugawa (1603–1868), when the country was
governed by Tokugawa shoguns; Meiji (1868–1905), when power
was returned to the Emperor Meiji and economic modernization
began; Imperial (1905–40), when heavy industries were founded;
and, finally, the Era of High Speed Growth (1950–90), when
Japan caught up with the rich countries of the West.

The roots of Japan’s success lie in the Tokugawa period, although
the country had many institutions that were inimical to economic
growth. Society was divided into castes – samurai, peasants,
artisans, and merchants – and the polity into several hundred
domains ruled by lords called daimyo. Domains could be
confiscated, and this created insecurity of property at the highest
social  level – rather like Elizabethan England. Draconian
restrictions were imposed on international trade and contacts.

116


Inbound ships were only allowed from China, Korea, and the
Netherlands, and the Dutch were restricted to a tiny settlement in
Nagasaki.

Technology advanced in the Tokugawa period, but the character of
the improvements was the reverse of Britain’s. Since wages were low
in East Asia, the Japanese invented technology that increased the
employment of labour in order to raise the productivity of land,
capital,    and materials. Labour, for instance, was deployed
constructing irrigation systems to raise crop yields. New varieties of
rice   such as akamai were planted, and water control allowed a
second crop such as wheat, cotton, sugar cane, mulberry, or rapeseed
to  be grown. Farmers worked more hours per hectare and used less
capital, as hoes were substituted for ploughs and draft animals.

Productivity in manufacturing processes was also improved.
Domains tried to attract industries and supported research to
raise  their productivity since more production led to more tax
revenue. In the case of silk, early experiments to use machinery
along English lines (for example, employing gear and belt systems
inspired by clocks and automatons) were abandoned since they
were  not economic. Instead, experiments were directed at
improving the productivity of silk worms. Selective breeding and
temperature control cut maturation time and boosted silk per
cocoon    by one-quarter. In mining, mechanical systems of drainage
were known but not used; instead, armies of workers did the
work. Likewise, much labour was expended to extract the
maximum amount of metal from ores. The exception that proves
the   rule was sake. Capital-intensive, water-powered factories were
installed but only because the government restricted production
by limiting the time during which breweries could operate. That
restriction led to high-volume plant design.

Tokugawa development produced uneven prosperity. The
population and rice crop both grew in the 17th century, but the
wages   of labourers stayed at ‘bare-bones’ subsistence. The average

117


person consumed about 1,800 calories per day in the late
Tokugawa and early Meiji periods. Most calories and protein came
from rice, potatoes, and beans rather than meat or fish. The
correlate was that people were short: men averaged 157 cm and
women 146 cm.

Many people, nonetheless, enjoyed a more affluent lifestyle. About
15% of the population lived in cities; Edo (modern-day Tokyo),
with  a population of one million, Osaka, and Kyoto (each
400,000) were amongst the largest cities in the world. Life
expectancy  was increasing. Leisure grew as peasants took
‘recreation   days’ and travelled around the country. School
attendance   was very high for an agrarian society. In 1868, 43% of
boys  and 10% of girls attended school, where they learned reading
and arithmetic. More than half of adult men were literate.

Reading for instruction and pleasure was widespread. Books were
too expensive for most people to buy, but they could be rented
from shops. In 1808, there were 656 rental bookshops in Edo,
supplying about 100,000 households (roughly half the
population)   with books. The high level of education was probably
due   to the commercialization of the Japanese economy, and it
underlay later growth.

Tokugawa Japan achieved an impressive level of engineering and
administrative competence that was apparent in the
establishment of the first iron foundry in Nagasaki. Military
necessity was the impetus. In 1808, HMS Phaeton entered the
city’s port to attack Dutch shipping. Phaeton threatened to
bombard the harbour unless provisions were provided. The
Japanese had no iron cannon to defend themselves since they had
no furnaces to cast them. Nabeshima Naomasa, who became the
lord ruling Nagasaki and who was an enthusiast for Western
science, established a team to create a cannon foundry. The group
included savants and craftsmen skilled in iron. They translated a
Dutch book describing a foundry in Leyden and replicated it. In
1850, they succeeded in building a reverberatory furnace, and

118


three years later were casting cannon. In 1854, the Nagasaki group
imported state-of-the-art, breech-loading Armstrong guns from
Britain and manufactured copies. By 1868, Japan had eleven
furnaces casting iron.

The Meiji Restoration

In 1839, the British attacked China to force the country to allow
the importation of opium, which was one of the East India
Company’s most lucrative products. Narco-imperialism triumphed
with China’s defeat in 1842. Would Japan be next? The answer
seemed to be ‘yes’ when the US Commodore Perry arrived with
four warships in 1853 and demanded that Japan end its
restrictions on foreign trade. Without a modern navy, Japan felt it
had    to agree and signed treaties with the USA, Britain, France,
and Russia. An adequate military was urgent. The Tokugawa
shogun took some steps to improve Japanese security, but many
regarded this as too little, too late.

In 1867, the Emperor Meiji ascended the thrown. Modernizers
effected a virtual coup d’état, and the last Tokugawa shogun
relinquished his powers. The slogan of the modernizers was ‘rich
country, strong army’.

The new regime undertook sweeping reforms. All of the feudal
domains were ‘surrendered’ to the Emperor, and the 1.9 million
samurai were paid off with government bonds. The four orders of
society were abolished, so anyone could take any job. The peasants
were confirmed in the ownership of their land and modern property
rights were created. Feudal payments were replaced by a land tax to
the national government. This provided most state income in the
1870s. In 1873, universal conscription was introduced and a
Western-style army created. This further eroded the privileges of
the   samurai, who had previously been the only people allowed to
bear arms. In 1890, a written constitution that created a
constitutional monarch on the Prussian model was adopted.

119


The radical spirit of Meiji Japan is shown by a simple problem –
the measurement of time. The traditional Japanese clock divided
the interval from sunrise to sunset into six hours and from sunset
to sunrise into another six hours. The day hour and the night
hour, therefore, differed in duration, and, moreover, the length of
each varied over the course of the year. Tokugawa clockmakers
experimented with ingenious modifications of Western
mechanical    clocks to reproduce these hours. In 1873, the first
Japanese railway was completed, and the Meiji government faced
the problem of publishing a timetable. Rather than a complicated
schedule with departure and arrival times varying over the year,
the  state instead abolished traditional Japanese time and replaced
it with the Western 24-hour clock. Modern transportation
required modern time.

Meiji economic development

The Meiji government would have liked to develop the country
with the standard model that had been successful in Western
Europe and North America, but they could easily introduce only
two   of its four components. The first was the creation of a national
market by abolishing the tariffs between domains and building a
railway network. The second was universal education. In 1872,
elementary schooling was made compulsory, and, by 1900, 90% of
the school-age children were enrolled. Secondary schools and
universities were founded but were limited and highly
competitive. Thousands of Japanese were sent abroad to study. As
a    result, education progressed much earlier in Japan than in other
poor countries. Table 6 contrasts Japan with Indonesia, a country
whose experience is representative of most of Asia and Africa. In
Japan, a high proportion of the population (10.8%) was in school
by  the late 19th century, and modern levels of participation
(19.7%) were reached by the Second World War. Indonesia, by
contrast, lagged several generations behind Japan. Mass education
was  an important reason for Japan’s success in adopting modern
technology.

The other components of the development model – investment
banks and a protective tariff – were harder to implement.

Tokugawa Japan had nothing like modern banks. The Meiji state
chartered banks from the outset, but the system was chaotic. It
took   50 years for Japan to develop a banking system along
German lines. Early in the Meiji period, the state filled the gap by
acting as the venture capitalist.

It was impossible for Japan to use tariffs to promote industrial
development because the maximum tariff rate was capped at 5%
by    a treaty forced on Japan by the Western powers in 1866.

Instead, the state intervened directly in the economy through
‘targeted industrial policy’. The most important actors were the
Ministries of the Interior and Industry, which were charged with
importing modern technology. The Ministry of Industry
established  Japan’s railway and telegraph systems in the 1870s and

121


1880s. Foreign technicians initially guided the project, but a school
to train Japanese engineers was established in Osaka, and the
foreigners were dispensed with as quickly as possible. One reason
the Japanese managed the projects was to ensure that
procurement policy promoted Japanese industry. Japanese potters,
for instance, received contracts to make insulators for telegraph
lines, and, in that way, an industrial ceramics industry was created.

In the 1870s and 1880s, both ministries operated on the assumption
that Japanese business would not introduce modern technology at
the required pace, so that the state had to be the entrepreneur.

State-owned mines and factories were established using advanced
imported machinery, but most were commercial failures. The
Tomioka silk-reeling factory, for instance, was built in 1872 with
French machinery and steam power but always lost money. In the
1880s, the Japanese government sold most of its industrial
establishments and relied on business to make management
decisions   within the framework established by the state. Japanese
business solved the problem of importing technology by

re-engineering it to make it appropriate for Japanese conditions.

Japan faced a problem that has only become worse with time:
modern technology was embodied in machinery and plant
specifications that were designed for Western firms facing Western
conditions. By the late 19th century, wages were much higher in the
West  than they were in Japan, so Western designs used much capital
and raw materials to economize on labour. This configuration was
inappropriate for Japan and resulted in high costs. Some countries
limped  along with inappropriate technology, but the Japanese
response was far more creative: they redesigned Western technology
to make it cost-effective in their low-wage economy.

Silk-reeling was an early example. At the same time that the
Tomioka mill was losing money, the Ono merchant family in Tsukiji
established a mill that also used European-inspired machinery. In
this  case, however, the machines were made of wood rather than

122


metal and the power came from men turning cranks rather than a
steam engine. The modification of Western technology along these
lines became common in Japan as the ‘Suwa method’. This was an
appropriate technology for Japan in that it used less expensive
capital and more cheap labour.

It was the same story with cotton. The early attempts to spin
with mules were not successful. Much more successful was the
garabô (rattling spindle) invented by Gaun Tokimune. The
garabô could be produced cheaply by local carpenters (so it
saved capital) and produced yarn similar to that produced by
hand wheels with which it was competing. The garabô was not
a high-level Meiji project, but it was supported by the
Association for Developing Production run by Gaun’s local
prefecture.

The contrast with India is telling. The cotton-spinning
industry that grew rapidly in Bombay in the 1870s used
English  mules, and the mills were operated in the same
manner    as in Britain. No systematic attempts were made to
reduce capital in the Indian industry. Such efforts were made
in Japan, however. An elementary step was to operate the mills
with two eleven-hour shifts per day rather than one, which was
normal in Britain and India. This cut capital per hour worked
in  half. From the 1890s onwards, high-speed ring spindles
were installed instead of mules. These changes in technique all
increased employment relative to capital and cut costs. By the
20th century, Japan was the world’s low-cost spinner of cotton
and was out-competing the Indians and Chinese as well as the
British.

Development of appropriate technology extended to
agriculture. The Japanese experimented with US farm
machinery     in the 1870s, but it was unsuccessful because it used
too  much capital. More successful were efforts to increase the
productivity of land, even if that required the use of more

123


labour. In 1877, shinriki rice was developed near Osaka. It gave
high yields if it was fertilized and if the paddy was thoroughly
tilled. Veteran farmers’ organizations were enlisted by the
Ministry  of Agriculture to spread this culture to the rest of the
country. Agricultural output grew steadily in Meiji Japan and
made  an important contribution to the growth of the economy
–  once invention focused on increasing the productivity of land,
the scarce and expensive factor of production.

The Imperial period, 1905–40

While Japanese society was overhauled in the Meiji period, change
in the economic structure was slow. The leading industries were
traditional – tea, silk, and cotton. Exports of these products paid
for imported machinery and raw materials.

Industrial growth accelerated between 1905 and 1940, and its
character changed. The share of manufacturing leapt from 20% of
GDP  in 1910 to 35% in 1938. The metallurgical, engineering, and
chemical industries that dominated post-war Japanese growth
were founded in this period, as were the famous firms that
produce these products.

These advances coincided with the full implementation of the
standard development model. Japan recovered control over its
tariffs   in 1894 and 1911, and they were immediately raised to
protect industry. By the 1920s, the banking system had matured
to  the point that it could finance industrial development. In
addition, Japan retained its system of targeted industrial policy.
The combination of policy instruments proved particularly potent
for promoting heavy industry.

The first step was taken in 1905 when the Yawata Steel Works
were established for strategic reasons. The plant was state-owned
and required subsidies for years before becoming profitable. The
First World War gave a boost to Japanese business since European

124


imports were cut off. After the war, the military undertook
research in conjunction with private companies, and promoted
key industries like automobiles, trucks, and aircraft with
procurement contracts. Large-scale firms, along with banks that
financed them, were owned by holding companies. These zaibatsu
coordinated production and channelled investment to industry.

While the zaibatsu aimed to deal with the shortage of capital in
Japan by increasing the rates of savings and investment,
management also responded to the factor prices it faced by
inventing appropriate technology. American firms operating in a
high-wage environment invented highly mechanized, assembly-
line production systems that economized on labour. Japanese
firms, in contrast, economized on raw materials and capital. One
of Japan’s most famous products was the Mitsubishi Zero fighter.
Its maximum speed of 500 kilometres per hour at 4,000 metres
was not achieved by increasing the power of its engine but instead
by reducing its weight. One expedient developed in the 1930s was
‘just in time’ production. Rather than producing components for
inventories that required capital to finance, Japanese businesses
produced components only as they were needed. ‘Just in time’
production is a technique that has proved to be so productive that
it    is now used in settings where capital is cheap as well as where it
is dear.

Unlike Tsarist Russia or Mexico, foreign investment was a
comparatively unimportant channel for importing Western
technology. Instead, Japanese firms established their own R&D
departments to copy it and re-engineer it to suit Japanese
conditions. Business was supported by the state. When it proved
impossible to import electrical turbines from Germany in 1914,
Hitachi was awarded a contract for a 10,000-horsepower turbine
for  a hydro-electric project. Since the largest turbine Hitachi had
previously built was 100-horsepower, there was much to learn,
and   the experience strengthened the firm’s engineering
capabilities.

Japan’s application of the standard development model was a
mixed success. On the one hand, an urban society with advanced
industries was created. Per capita GDP increased from $737 in
1870   to $2,874 in 1940. Given the stagnation that gripped most of
the Third World, these achievements were impressive. On the
other hand, the rate of growth in per capita income (2.0% per
year) was modest and not much above the US rate of 1.5%. If
these rates had continued after 1950, it would have taken Japan
327 years to catch up to the USA. That was not fast enough.

The slow growth of the economy was reflected in weaknesses in
the labour market, as in Russia and Mexico. The large-scale firms
paid high wages, but wages remained very low in agriculture and
small-scale industry because labour demand was weak. These
sectors continued to use hand technology or only simple
machines. There was a symbiosis between the modern and
traditional sectors: if a stage in a modern production process
could    be performed least expensively by small-scale, handicraft
methods, then it was subcontracted to a small firm.

Latin America

Latin America has undertaken the most recent experiments with
the standard model. These began at the same time as the
southern part of the continent was integrated into the world
economy.

Mexico, the Andes, Brazil, and the Caribbean had been part of
the world economy since the 16th century, but southern Latin
America was too far from Europe for trade to be viable. After
1860, efficient steamships made it profitable to export wheat
from Argentina and Uruguay, and guano and copper from the
Pacific coast of the continent. Meat exports were added to the list
in 1877, when the first refrigerated ship, Le Frigorifique, carried
frozen mutton from Buenos Aires to Rouen. Exports boomed,
and  the region attracted settlers and capital from Europe. By

126


1900, the southern cone was one of the richest regions in the
world, and Argentina joined Mexico in developing
manufacturing.

Many Latin American countries were too small to become
industrial nations and continued to export primary products and
import manufactures – and continued to be poor. The larger
economies, on the other hand, experimented with the standard
development model in the late 19th century and persevered with it
until   the 1980s, when it was dubbed ‘import substitution
industrialization’ (ISI). First, 90,000 kilometres of railways were
laid       in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and Chile by 1913. Second,
tariffs protected industries like textiles and iron. Third, the
Russian model was followed with investment financed abroad.

Fourth, a notable lapse, however, was the failure to provide
universal education. Argentina was the great exception, for it
mandated compulsory, free schooling in 1884. As a result,
Argentina (followed closely by Chile) led the continent, with over
half  its adult population literate in 1900 – compared to one-
quarter in Mexico, Venezuela, and Brazil.

Manufacturing development gathered pace behind tariffs in the
1920s and 1930s, and the low prices of the continent’s agricultural
exports lent weight to arguments for industrial development. This
sentiment was turned into doctrine by the UN Economic
Commission   on Latin America, under the direction of the
Argentine economist Raul Prebish. The Economic Development of
Latin America and its Principal Problems (1950) contended that
the prices of the primary products exported by Latin America
were falling with respect to the prices of the manufactured
imports and recommended state promotion of industry to counter
the trend. This so-called ‘dependency theory’ has been politically
influential, although its claims are debatable. Consider examples
in    this book. The history of palm oil and cocoa are in accord with
the theory since their prices have fallen with respect to the price of
cotton cloth since the mid-19th century (Figures 17 and 18).

127


However, the price of raw cotton rose with respect to the price of
cloth in India in the 19th century, leading to de-industrialization
(Figures 12 and 13).

Dependency theory led to a comprehensive application of the
standard model. Education was finally made universal.

Development banks were created to fund development, while
foreign investment became the vehicle for financing industry and
introducing advanced technology. Tariffs and government controls
were  used to promote a range of modern industries.

Manufacturing output and urbanization soared. Per capita income
more than doubled between 1950 and 1980. Foreign debt grew as
well, however, and could no longer be serviced when interest rates
rose in the early 1980s. Mexico defaulted in 1982, Western banks
called in loans, and Latin America went into recession. The
standard model had reached its limits.

The failure of tariff-induced industrialization also reflected deeper
factors like the evolution of technology. The difference in wages
between rich and poor countries had grown, so that the new
highly capital intensive technology of the 1950s was even less
suitable to poor countries than was the technology of 1850. In
addition,  a new problem appeared. The new technology of the
mid-20th century involved not only high capital to labour ratios
but   also large plant sizes. These were often too big for the markets
of poor countries.

Automobiles are an important example. Most Latin American
countries promoted their production, but markets were too small
for efficient operation. The MES (minimum efficient size) for
vehicle assembly plants in the 1960s was 200,000 autos per year.
The MES for engines and transmissions was closer to one million
per year, while sheet metal presses could produce four million
units in their lifetime. Only seven companies (GM, Ford, Chrysler,
Renault, VW, Fiat, and Toyota) produced at least one million
autos   per year and had engine, transmission, and assembly plants

128


of MES. (Efficiency in metal stamping was realized by changing
body design only every few years.) Smaller firms were burdened
with higher costs.

Latin American car markets were smaller. In the 1950s, about
50,000 new cars were sold each year in Argentina. The
Automotive Decree of 1959 required that 90% of the content of
vehicles  sold in the country be manufactured there. Production
grew  at 24% per year until 1965, when 195,000 vehicles were
produced, and automobiles accounted for 10% of the economy. ISI
looked a great success in terms of the growth in output, but the
industry was far too small to realize the economies of large-scale
production. The small size of the national market was exacerbated
by   its division amongst 13 firms, the largest of which produced
only 57,000 vehicles. The upshot was that the cost of producing an
automobile in Argentina was 2.5 times the cost in the USA.
Argentina  could never compete internationally with this industrial
structure, and the overall efficiency of the economy was dragged
down   by this sector. Since the same story was repeated in steel,
petrochemicals, and other industries, ISI played a big role in
depressing   GDP per worker and, hence, the standard of living.

The contrast with the 19th century is stark. Scale was not an
issue then. Around 1850, a typical cotton mill had 2,000 spindles
and processed 50 tons of yarn per year. The USA consumed
about 100,000 tons of yarn annually, so it could accommodate
2,000 cotton mills of the MES. It was the same story in other
modern industries: a blast furnace produced 5,000 tons per year
and total consumption in the USA was about 800,000 tons, or
160 times MES; a rail mill rolled 15,000 tons of rails per year,
while the USA laid 400,000 tons (only 27 times more!). The
high USA and European tariffs raised the prices paid by
consumers in the 19th century, but they did not burden their
economies with an inefficient industrial structure. That is a
fundamental reason why the standard model worked in North
America   but not in South America.

129


The end of the standard model

In Tsarist Russia, Japan, and Latin America, the standard model
generated modest economic growth, but not enough to close the
gap  with the West. With per capita GDP growing at about 2% per
year in the advanced countries, poor countries had to generate at
least that much growth just to stay even and very much more to
catch up in a short time-frame. Tsarist Russia, Japan, and Latin
America could not do that with the standard model. A corollary
was  the slow growth of labour demand that fell short of the
growth in population. As a result, Tsarist Russia and Latin
America suffered from high inequality and political instability.

Many groups in pre-Second World War Japan – workers in
agriculture and small-scale industry and women generally –
likewise  failed to share in the growth. These problems have
worsened with time as the scale of efficient production has
increased  and capital to labour ratios have become even greater in
rich countries. Even without the financial crisis of the early 1980s,
the standard model had reached the end of its useful life. What
would replace it?

Chapter 9

Big Push industrialization

The West pulled further ahead of most of the rest of the world in
the 20th century, but some countries bucked the trend and
caught up, notably, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and (less
completely) the Soviet Union. China looks on course to do the
same.  Growth in these countries was very rapid, and the gap was
closed in half a century. They began their growth spurts with an
income per head equal to only 20–25% of that in the advanced
countries. With the latter growing at 2% per year, the poor
country   could catch up in two generations (60 years) only if its
per capita GDP grew at 4.3% per year. This requires total GDP
to grow at 6% or more per year depending on population growth.
That is a high hurdle. The only way large countries have been
able  to grow so fast is by constructing all of the elements of an
advanced economy – steel mills, power plants, vehicle factories,
cities,  and so on – simultaneously. This is Big Push
industrialization.  It raises difficult problems since everything is
built     ahead of supply and demand. The steel mills are built
before  the auto factories that will use their rolled sheets. The
auto plants are built before the steel they will fabricate is
available and, indeed, before there is effective demand for their
products. Every investment depends on faith that the
complementary investments will materialize. The success of the
grand    design requires a planning authority to coordinate the
activities and ensure that they are carried out. The large

131


economies that have broken out of poverty in the 20th century
have managed to do this, although they varied considerably in
their planning apparatus.

Soviet economic development

The Soviet Union is the classic example of a Big Push. The 1917
Revolution was followed by four years of civil war, which was won
by   the Bolsheviks, who conceded the peasants’ demands for
ownership of the land and its equal division among the farming
population. By 1928, the New Economic Policy had revived the
economy, Lenin was dead, and Stalin was in power.

The USSR faced the same problem as other poor countries: most
of the population was in the countryside engaged in handicraft
production and small-scale agriculture. The country needed to
build    a modern, urban economy. That, in turn, required massive
investment in modern technology. The Soviet solution was central
planning, and the Five Year Plan became its symbol. Since Soviet
businesses were state-owned, they could be directed with
instructions  from the top (the plan) instead of following the
incentives   of the market. For a long time, the Soviet model looked
like   a great success and inspired planned development in many
poor countries.

The Soviet Big Push began with the first Five Year Plan in 1928.
The growth strategy rested on four legs. The first was channelling
investment into heavy industry and machinery production. This
accelerated the capacity to build capital equipment and thereby
pushed  up the rate of investment. The USSR was large enough to
absorb the output of large-scale factories, which became the norm.
The second was the use of demanding output targets to direct
business operations. Since maximizing output might lead to
losses,  bank credit was liberally given to businesses so that they
could cover their costs. The ‘hard budget constraints’ of capitalism
were replaced by ‘soft budget constraints’. Third, agriculture was

132


collectivized. Politically, this was the most controversial policy
since it was anathema to the peasants, who preferred small family
farms and periodic redistributions of land by the village to ensure
equality. In the event, collectivization resulted in a huge fall in
farm output and led to famine in 1933. The fourth was mass
education. Schooling was quickly made universal and compulsory.
Adult education was pursued vigorously to cut the time for the
whole labour force to be trained.

These measures caused the economy to grow rapidly. By the time
the Germans invaded in 1940, thousands of factories, dams, and
power plants had been built. The plans tilted investment to heavy
industry, which boomed. By 1940, pig iron production had
increased from a pre-war maximum of 4 million tons per year to
15 million tons. This was twice as much as Britain produced, but
still only half as much as the USA. Electric power generation
went from 5 to 42 billion kilowatt-hours. (Lenin once quipped
that Communism meant ‘Soviet power plus the electrification of
the whole country’. By that definition, the Revolution was a
success.) The investment rate rose from about 8% of GDP in 1928
to  19% in 1939.

The production of consumer products also increased but by a
smaller amount. Partly, this reflected priorities; partly, it was due
to  the disastrous collectivization of agriculture. Production
rebounded by the end of the decade, however. In 1939, the USSR
processed about 900,000 tons of ginned cotton. This was double
the  1913 level, 50% more than Great Britain (whose output had
fallen considerably due to Japanese competition), but only 52% of
the USA’s. While per capita consumption fell sharply in 1932 and
1933, there was a 20% rise in average living standards between
1928 and 1939. In addition, educational and health services were
enormously extended.

The Second World War was a huge blow to the USSR: 15% of the
Soviet citizens lost their lives (mortality among men aged 20–49

133


reached 40%), and housing and factories were destroyed.
However, the capital stock was restored by 1950, and rapid
economic growth resumed. Investment was kept at about 38% of
GDP.  By 1975, the USSR produced more than 100 million tons of
pig iron and had surpassed the USA. Consumer goods output also
increased rapidly. It looked like the Soviet model might really be
the   best way for a poor country to develop.

And then it all went wrong. The growth rate gradually declined
in the 1970s and 1980s. By the end of the decade, it was nil.

President Gorbachev called for ‘restructuring’ (perestroika).
Central planning gave way to the market, but it was too late to
save the USSR, and it was dissolved.

In the case of the Soviet Union, there are really two questions.
First, what went right? Why did the GDP per head grow so rapidly
from 1928 to the 1970s? Part of the answer relates to ‘GDP’ and
part to ‘heads’. GDP grew rapidly since Soviet institutions were
effective in building large-scale, modern factories. Channelling
investment into heavy industry increased the capacity to build
structures and equipment, and soft budget constraints created
jobs    for people who would otherwise have been unemployed in a
surplus labour economy. Even the collectivization of agriculture
made  a contribution (although a small one) by accelerating the
migration of people to the cities where the new jobs lay. At the
outset, planning did not require much vision since the object was
to  fit Western technology to Russian geography.

The second reason that GDP per head grew rapidly was because
population growth was slow. The number of people rose from 155
million  in 1920 to 290 million in 1990. In part, slow growth was
due  to excess mortality from collectivization and, especially, the
Second World War, but their importance was dwarfed by the
decline  in the fertility rate. In the 1920s, the average Soviet
woman  had seven children. By the 1960s, this had dropped to

2.5. The growth in urbanization made a contribution,

134


but the most important cause in the USSR (as in poor countries
generally) was the education of women and their paid
employment outside the home.

Second, what went wrong? Why did growth slow in the 1970s and
1980s? The possible answers range from the transient to the
fundamental and include the end of the surplus labour economy,
the squandering of investment on Siberian development, the arms
race with the USA which drained R&D resources from civilian
industry, the increased difficulty of planning once technological
catch-up was completed and the task was to design the future, the
impossibility of central control (what would happen to the US
economy    if the president had to manage it?), and the cynicism and
conformity bred by dictatorship. The collapse of the Soviet Union
led  many observers to reject state planning and celebrate the
virtues of the free market. However, other countries did better
with alternative forms of planning.

Japan

The aims of Japanese policy before the Second World War were
summarized in the slogan ‘rich country, strong army’. Defeat in the
war   led Japan to reject the ‘strong army’, but it pursued ‘rich
country’ with even greater commitment. Japan needed a Big Push
to close the income gap with the West. The project was
remarkably successful. Per capita income grew at 5.9% per year
between 1950 and 1990, with a peak rate of 8% between 1953 and
1973. By 1990, West European living standards had been
achieved.

Japan accomplished this advance by reversing the technology
policy that it had pursued in the Meiji and Imperial periods.
Instead of adjusting modern technology to its factor prices, Japan
adopted the most modern, capital-intensive technology on a vast
scale. The investment rate reached about one-third of national
income in the 1970s. The capital stock grew so rapidly that a

135


high-wage economy was created within a generation. Factor prices
adjusted to the new technological environment, rather than the
other  way around.

Japanese industrialization in the post-war period required
planning, and the key agency was the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry (MITI). The policy tools that Japan had
perfected in the 1920s and 1930s were used to accelerate the
growth rate.

MITI concerned itself with two kinds of problems. One related to
the scale of production – the issue that defeated ISI in Latin
America. Steel was one of Japan’s great successes. Production had
increased from 2.4 million tons in 1932 to a peak of 7.7 million
tons   in 1943, then dropped to 0.5 million in 1945, and had
returned to 4.8 million in 1950. A key feature of steel production
is  that costs are minimized with large-scale, capital-intensive
mills. In 1950, minimum efficient size was 1–2.5 million tons.

Most US mills were bigger than that, but only one Japanese mill
(Yawata, with a capacity of 1.8 million tons) was in the range. The
rest  of Japan’s mills produced half a million tons or less. As a
result, Japanese steel was at least 50% more expensive than US or
European steel, despite Japan’s low wages. MITI’s objective in the
1950s was to restructure Japan’s industry so that all steel was
produced in mills of efficient size. MITI’s power came from its
control  of the banking system and its authority to allocate foreign
exchange, which was needed to import coking coal and iron ore.
By  1960, capacity had grown to 22 million tons in modernized,
large-scale mills. After 1960, MITI’s guidance was less direct.

Expansion continued through the construction of new facilities on
‘green field’ sites. These were all of minimum efficient size, which
had by then increased to about 7 million tons; in contrast, most
capacity in the USA was in old mills of less than efficient size.

Japanese mills were also technically more advanced. 83% of
Japan’s steel in the mid-1970s was smelted in basic oxygen
furnaces against 62% in the USA, and 35% was continuously cast

136


compared to 11% in the USA. Despite a large increase in wages,
Japan was the world’s low-cost steel producer due to its
commitment to modern capital-intensive technology. Over 100
million tons were produced in 1975.

Who was going to buy all that steel? Shipbuilding, automobiles,
machinery, and construction were major domestic purchasers.
Those industries had to expand in step with the steel industry.
Ensuring that result was a second planning problem. Their
technologies also had to be decided, and a large-scale, capital-
intensive approach was taken with these as with steel. In the case
of automobiles, for instance, Japanese firms had more capital per
worker than their US counterparts, and the Japanese capital was
more effective since ‘just in time’ delivery meant that much less of
it consisted of unfinished components. Also, the scale of
production was larger in Japan. In the 1950s, the minimum
efficient   size of assembly plants was close to 200,000 vehicles per
year. Ford, Chrysler, and General Motors annually produced
150,000–200,000 vehicles per plant. In the 1960s, new Japanese
auto    plants incorporated on site stamping and multiple assembly
lines to push the minimum efficient size above 400,000 units per
year. All Japanese manufacturers produced at this level, and the
most efficient, like Honda and Toyota, could reach 800,000
vehicles per plant per year. Japan’s move to highly capital-
intensive methods created the most efficient industry in the world,
and one which could price its products competitively and still pay
high wages.

A third planning problem was to ensure an expansion of
consumer demand in Japan to purchase these consumer durables.
Japan’s distinctive industrial relations institutions made a
contribution: among large firms, company unions, seniority
wages,     and lifetime employment meant that some of the surplus
of successful firms was shared with their employees. Small firms,
however, provided many jobs in Japan, and in the 1950s (as in the
interwar period), they paid low wages. During the 1960s and

137


1970s, the vast expansion of industry ended the labour surplus,
and the dual economy disappeared, as wages in the small firm
sector rose rapidly. Rising incomes from the expansion of
employment led to a revolution in lifestyle as Japanese bought
refrigerators and automobiles made with the enlarged supply of
steel.   Not only did the Japanese have more gadgets, but they ate
better and grew taller. In 1891, the average conscript was 157 cm
tall, while his counterpart in 1976 was 168 cm. Japanese consumer
spending validated the decisions to expand capacity and raise
wages,   so that the capital-intensive technology was appropriate –
after the fact, if not before.

A final planning problem related to the international market. This
problem had ramifications far beyond MITI. In the mid-1970s,
the Japanese steel industry was exporting almost one-third of its
output, mainly to the USA. Similar percentages of automobiles
and consumer durables were also shipped there. The US
production of steel and autos collapsed under the impact of
Japanese competition; indeed, the decline of the American Rust
Belt was the counterpart to Japan’s Economic Miracle. The USA
could easily have prevented these imports by continuing the high
tariff policy it had followed since 1816. So-called ‘voluntary export
restraints’ were negotiated, but they were only temporary
expedients. Instead, the USA elected to cut tariffs but only if other
countries did likewise (multilateral trade liberalization). One
reason was that the USA emerged from the Second World War as
the world’s most competitive economy, so expanding its export
opportunities seemed more rewarding than unnecessarily
protecting its home market. Japan’s export success called this
assumption into question. Japan, however, had established itself
as the USA’s bulwark against Communism in East Asia, and its
geopolitical importance maintained its trade options.

The era of high-speed growth could not last forever. The end of
the boom is conventionally dated to the collapse of the real estate
and share bubbles in 1991, which ushered in an era of deflation.

138


The cause, however, was more fundamental, for it was the
elimination of the conditions that allowed rapid growth in the first
place. Japan grew rapidly by closing three gaps with the West – in
capital per worker, education per worker, and productivity. This
was done by 1990, and Japan was then like any other advanced
country: it could grow only as fast as the world’s technology
frontier expanded – a per cent or two each year. The post-1990
growth slowdown was inevitable.

China

South Korea and Taiwan have followed close on Japan’s heels in
catching up to the West. Both were Japanese colonies, which gave
them  an ambiguous start. Modern educational systems were
created, but the emphasis was on teaching Japanese rather than
Korean or Taiwanese. Infrastructure and agricultural development
aimed to make the colonies food suppliers for Japan. Per capita
income reached $1,548 in 1940. Following the Second World War,
the Japanese were expelled, their property seized, and their land
holdings redistributed among the rural population, creating
egalitarian peasant societies. Beginning in the 1950s, both
countries vigorously pursued industrialization. South Korea, in
particular, followed the Japanese Big Push model closely.

Advanced technology was imported and mastered by Korean
firms since foreign firms were excluded from the country. The
state planned investment and restricted imports to protect the
Korean manufacturers it promoted. As in Japan, high quality and
performance were advanced by requiring these firms to export
large  fractions of their production. Korea established the heavy
industries like steel, shipbuilding, and autos that were Japan’s
successes, and, a decade or two later, they became Korea’s
successes    as well.

The rise of South Korea and Taiwan is impressive but will be
dwarfed in significance if China continues to industrialize as
rapidly  as it has in recent decades. When the Communists seized

139


power in 1949, GDP per capita was at rock bottom ($448). By
2006, income reached $6,048 per head, placing China among the
middle-income countries. This was far better performance than
most    of Asia, Africa, or Latin America (Table 1).

How did China do it? The usual answer is ‘free-market reforms’,
but this is incomplete. The economic history of China since 1949
divides into two periods – the planning period (1950–78) and the
reform period (1978 to present). In the first, China adopted a
Communist system with collective farms, state-owned industry,
and   central planning along Soviet lines. The development strategy
favoured the expansion of heavy industry to create the machinery
and structures of an urban, industrial society. The investment rate
was pushed to about one-third of GDP, and industrial output grew
rapidly. Technology policy, dubbed ‘walking on two legs’, combined
capital-intensive, advanced technology with labour-intensive
manufacturing  where feasible. Steel production, always an
objective       of Big Push industrializers, jumped from about 1 million
tons  per year in 1950 to 32 million in 1978. Despite gyrations in
policy, including the Great Leap Forward (1958–60), the
subsequent famine, and the Cultural Revolution (1967–9), per
capita  income more than doubled from $448 in 1950 to $978 in
1978 (2.8% per year). This was no mean achievement but did not
distinguish China from many other poor countries.

Following Mao’s death in 1976, Deng Xiaoping began ‘reforms’ in
1978. Planning has been dismantled and a market economy
created  in its stead. Unlike Eastern Europe’s ‘shock therapy’, China
has reformed by gradually modifying and supplementing its
institutions. Since 1978, growth has also surged.

The first reforms were in agriculture and illustrate the complexity
of the issues. Two reforms were particularly important: First, in
1979 and 1981, state procurement agencies increased their
purchase prices by a total of 40–50% for production beyond the
obligatory deliveries specified in the plan. Second, collective

140


cultivation was replaced by the Household Responsibility System.
Under the HRS, the land of the collectives was divided into small
farms leased to families, who were obliged to deliver their share of
the commune’s plan obligations but who were allowed to keep the
income from sales at the high prices for production that exceeded
quotas.

Farm output surged as these policies were put in place, and that is
the main case for their importance. Between 1970 and 1978, GDP
originating in agriculture grew at 4.9% per year, which is even
more  than the 3.9% realized between 1985 and 2000. However,
between 1978 and 1984, output leapt up at 8.8% per year. Grain
production also grew faster in 1978–84 than it did before or after.
Since  the rise in prices and the HRS increased the financial
incentive for peasants to increase output, the usual conclusion is
that  the policy changes caused the output growth.

Reform, however, has to share the credit with other developments
that were consequences of earlier planning decisions. The reason
that Chinese farmers could increase output was because they
could use advanced technology that was also coming together at
the same time as rural institutions were reformed. Increasing
grain yields requires three improvements under Chinese
conditions  – better water control, high-yielding seed, and
fertilizer.  There was a large increase in irrigated acreage in China
between the 1950s and 1970s, and millions of tube wells were
drilled  in north China to supply water there. The increase in the
supply of water contributed to the growth in grain output during
the planning period, and was a prerequisite for the rapid output
growth around 1980.

Dramatic yield increases required seed that responded to fertilizer.
The biological problem is a general one in the tropics: if fertilizer
is applied to the traditional varieties of rice, they produce more
leaves and longer stalks. The plant eventually topples over
(lodges), preventing the formation of grain. The solution lies in

141


dwarf rice with fibrous stalks that do not lodge, so that the extra
growth from fertilizing goes into seed rather than foliage.

Japanese rice was naturally of this character, which was the
biological basis for the growth in farm output in the Meiji period.
Japanese rice could not be cultivated further south, however, due
to differences in the length of the day, so it was necessary to breed
dwarf varieties suitable to tropical latitudes. The most famous is
IR-8, which was developed at the International Rice Research
Institute in the Philippines and released in 1966. IR-8 and its
successors have been the basis of the Green Revolution in much of
Asia. What is less well appreciated is that China got there first.

The Chinese Academy of Sciences’ breeding programme produced
a high-yield dwarf rice two years before IR-8. It was the diffusion
of the new dwarf rice that caused Chinese farm output to explode.

High-yielding rice gives high yields only if it is heavily fertilized.
In the 1970s, Chinese farmers were already using traditional
fertilizers to the maximum. Heavier application required the
industrial production of nitrate. Efforts to increase fertilizer
production  in the 1960s had not been particularly successful, so in
1973–4 the state purchased 13 ammonia factories from foreign
suppliers. These came on stream in the late 1970s and provided
the fertilizer that caused yields to shoot up. There is no way to
know whether the rise in farm output between 1978 and 1984
required the reforms or whether it would have occurred anyway.

The character of technological change in Chinese agriculture
resembles that of Japan and reflects the development of
technology tailored to the country’s factor proportions. As in
Japan, labour was abundant and land scarce, so technological
advance has until recently concentrated on augmenting the
productivity of land. Comparatively little investment has been
directed towards saving labour. The history of the Green
Revolution in China differs in this respect from its history in
India, where mechanization accompanied the adoption of
high-yielding crops. Access to cheaper credit gave large-scale

142


farmers the advantage in India, and they increased the size of
their holdings at the expense of small farmers, who often lost their
land. Farm machinery allowed fewer people to cultivate the soil.
China avoided these conflicts. The communal ownership of land
equalized holdings in China and preserved small farms, which was
a  more rational response to the abundance of labour and scarcity
of capital, as well as being more equitable.

Reforms have also transformed the industrial sector. The first
steps were also taken in the countryside. Manufacturing

by-employments had always been a feature of rural China and
were taken up by collective farms. After 1978, ‘township and
village enterprises’ (TVEs) were promoted by local party officials.
Consumer goods production had lagged, and the TVEs filled the
gap, selling their goods in the free market. The consumer goods
industries had low capital to labour ratios (unlike the heavy
industries that were the focus of planning), so the TVEs used
appropriate technology for China, which is why they succeeded in
market competition. Between 1978 and 1996, TVE employment
grew from 28 million to 135 million, and TVEs increased their
share of GDP from 6% to 26%. Marketization was extended
throughout the state sector from the mid-1980s when the state
froze   its plan targets and allowed enterprises to sell production
beyond plan requirements on the free market. Since then, the
economy has ‘outgrown the plan’ and become increasingly
market-driven, as it has expanded.

In 1992, the 14th Party Congress endorsed the ‘socialist market
economy’ as the goal of reform, and material balance planning,
the centrepiece of central planning, was abolished. Subsequent
reforms created a financial system to take the place of state
allocation  of investment and converted state-owned enterprises
from government departments into publicly owned corporations.
The reform of state-owned industry has involved deep cuts in
employment and closing down unproductive capacity. This is a
result   that the USSR never accomplished and which may have

143


contributed to its growth slowdown by locking a large share of the
work force in unproductive jobs rather than redeploying them to
new, high-productivity facilities. As investment has become more
market-driven, the investment rate has remained high. The state
remains  active, if less formally involved, in guiding investment in
energy and heavy industry. Perhaps for this reason, the steel
industry has continued to grow explosively. It now produces 500
million tons per year. The USA, the USSR, and Japan never
produced more than 150 million tons, so China has broken all
world records. China’s population is, of course, much larger, but
production per head, now 377 kg (up from 2 kg per head in 1950
and   102 kg as recently as 2001), has reached the consumption
level of rich countries. Between 1978 and 2006, per capita income
grew at 6.7% per year.

The reforms are the usual explanation for the high growth rate. As
with agriculture, the explanation is incomplete. China’s ‘reformed
institutions’ may have improved the country’s performance
compared to Mao’s system, but they have not produced superior
institutions to those found in most poor countries of the world;
indeed, were China growing slowly, its slow growth would be
blamed on the property rights, legal system, and Communist
dictatorship that it now has. The crucial comparative question
about China is not ‘why have China’s mediocre market institutions
performed better than central planning?’, but rather ‘why have its
mediocre market institutions worked as well as they have?’ The
answer may come down to legacies from the planning period or
other features of China’s society or its policies that distinguish it
from poor countries generally.

Legacies from the planning period have certainly played a role.
These include a highly educated population, a large industrial
sector, low mortality and fertility rates, and, despite the Cultural
Revolution, a scientific establishment with significant R&D
capabilities. Primary education was expanded throughout the
planning period, with the result that two-thirds of the population

144


were literate according to the 1982 census, and vocational skills
were also widespread. Life expectancy had increased from less
than 30 years in the 1930s to 41 in the 1950s, to 60 in the 1970s.
(It reached 70 in 2000.) The average number of children born to
the average woman (the total fertility rate) dropped from over 6 in
the 1950s to 2.7 in the late 1970s – even before the one child policy
in 1980. As in the USSR, low fertility was probably the result of
educating women and giving them the chance to earn money in
paid employment.

However historians ultimately factor out the importance of the
planning legacy, reformed institutions, sensible policy, and
supportive culture, China is completing a historical cycle. If the
country grows as rapidly in the next three decades as it has since
1978,  it will close the gap with the West. China will become the
world’s biggest manufacturing nation just as it was before the
voyages of Christopher Columbus and Vasco da Gama. The world
will have come full circle.

145


Epilogue

China is on course to catch up with the West, but what of Africa,
Latin America, and the rest of Asia? Income per head in the rich
countries grows at about 2% per year, so countries must grow
faster  than that to close the gap. Many poor countries in Asia and
Latin America would have to grow at 4.3% per person per year to
catch up to the rich countries in 60 years. For that to happen, total
GDP would have to grow at least 6% per year for 60 years. Much
poorer countries, like many in sub-Saharan Africa, would have to
grow even faster, or it would take even longer to catch up.

Very few countries have sustained such rapid growth over a long
period. Between 1955 and 2005, there were only ten. Oman,
Botswana, and Equatorial Guinea are special cases in that large oil
or diamond reserves were discovered during this period.

Singapore and Hong Kong are city states, and that makes them
special since there was no peasant agricultural sector to swamp
the  city with migrants when investment rose. Wages could,
therefore, increase in step with labour demand, and prosperity
could spread. The interesting cases are the large countries with
large agricultural sectors – Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand,
and China. In addition, the Soviet Union could be added since
income per head grew at 4.5% per year from 1928 to 1970 if the
Second World War decade is left out.

These countries had to close three gaps with the West – in
education, capital, and productivity. Mass schooling closed the

146


education gap, and one form or another of state-led
industrialization closed the capital and productivity gaps.
Large-scale, capital-intensive technologies were adopted even
when  they were not immediately cost-effective. These countries

have avoided the inefficiencies that Latin America has endured in
trying to shoe-horn modern technology into small economies
either because they were so large that they could absorb the
output of efficient facilities or because they were given access to
the American market at the expense of American production.

Which of the many initiatives followed by these countries was the
most effective, however, remains the subject of a great deal of
debate. Also, it is not so clear whether the successful policies can
be transplanted to other countries. The best policy to effect
economic development, therefore, remains very much in dispute.

ECONOMICS

A Very Short Introduction

Partha Dasgupta

Economics has the capacity to offer us deep insights into
some of the most formidable problems of life, and offer
solutions  to them too. Combining a global approach with
examples from everyday life, Partha Dasgupta describes the
lives   of two children who live very different lives in different
parts of the world: in the Mid-West USA and in Ethiopia. He
compares the obstacles facing them, and the processes that
shape their lives, their families, and their futures. He shows
how economics uncovers these processes, finds explanations
for them, and how it forms policies and solutions.

‘An excellent introduction . . . presents mathematical and statistical
findings in straightforward prose.’

GLOBALIZATION

A Very Short Introduction

Manfred Steger

‘Globalization’ has become one of the defining buzzwords
of our time – a term that describes a variety of accelerating
economic, political, cultural, ideological, and environmental

processes that are rapidly altering our experience of the world.
It is by its nature a dynamic topic – and this Very Short
Introduction has been fully updated for 2009, to include
developments  in global politics, the impact of terrorism, and
environmental issues. Presenting globalization in accessible
language   as a multifaceted process encompassing global,
regional, and local aspects of social life, Manfred B. Steger
looks   at its causes and effects, examines whether it is a new
phenomenon, and explores the question of whether,
ultimately, globalization is a good or a bad thing.
